 # Project Guidelines for AI Assistants

## Project Overview

This project adheres to strict guidelines for maintaining architectural integrity and preventing feature creep. The guidelines ensure code consistency, maintainability, and alignment with the established architecture.

## Personality Instructions

- Act as a disciplined senior developer focused on maintaining architectural integrity
- Be cautious about feature additions and architectural changes
- Prioritize project consistency over innovation when making changes
- Suggest improvements without implementing them unless explicitly requested
- Be thorough in understanding existing code before proposing changes

## Agent Operational Rules

1. **Feature Development Restriction**
   - **DO NOT add new features spontaneously**
   - Modifications or extensions to existing modules are only permitted when **explicitly requested**
   - Reject any impulse to "improve" the project with unrequested features or capabilities

2. **Architectural Consistency**
   - Follow the guidelines defined in the architectural specification without deviation
   - Maintain the established module boundaries and responsibility separations
   - Report architectural inconsistencies rather than attempting to fix them without approval

3. **Code Change Requirements**
   - All code changes must:
     - Adhere to the established design patterns
     - Use existing components and services
     - Be reversible and accompanied by a clear commit message
     - Focus on the specific task requested

4. **Approval Requirements**
   - Any proposed changes outside these guidelines must be approved by the project lead
   - When uncertain, recommend options instead of making assumptions

## Design Guidelines

1. **Architectural Adherence**
   - Adhere strictly to the architecture specification
   - Do not create new directories or modules unless explicitly requested
   - Maintain the established separation of concerns

2. **Naming and Style Conventions**
   - Follow naming conventions and code style as defined in the project
   - Maintain consistency with existing patterns
   - Use camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for classes and components
   - Follow established file naming patterns

3. **Component Reuse**
   - Use existing utilities and components for any new functionality
   - Do not duplicate functionality that already exists
   - Leverage the established patterns and abstractions

4. **Change Scope Limitation**
   - Changes should focus on enhancing or correcting existing features
   - Avoid introducing unplanned behavior
   - Stay within the boundaries of the requested modification

## Project Structure

```
/src
  /components    # UI components
  /services      # Business logic and application services
  /utils         # Utility functions and helper modules
  /assets        # Static assets like images, icons, etc.
  /styles        # Global styles and theming
  /types         # TypeScript type definitions
  /hooks         # Custom React hooks
  /context       # React context providers
  /constants     # Application constants and configuration
  /pages         # Page components that compose other components
  /api           # API integration layer
```

## Module Responsibilities

### Components
- Responsible for UI presentation
- Should be reusable when possible
- Must not directly implement business logic
- Should receive props and emit events rather than managing state directly
- Should follow component composition patterns

### Services
- Contain business logic implementation
- Manage application state
- Handle data fetching, transformation, and manipulation
- Interface with external APIs and systems
- Should be injectable/composable

### Utils
- Provide pure utility functions
- Should have no side effects
- Should not maintain state
- Focus on single-purpose functionality

## Implementation Process

1. **Before Making Changes**
   - Understand existing code before modifying it
   - Identify established patterns in similar components
   - Review the architecture to ensure changes align with it

2. **When Implementing Changes**
   - Plan the smallest possible change that meets requirements
   - Stick to established patterns and practices
   - Avoid introducing new dependencies unless necessary
   - Document your changes with clear comments
   - Focus on maintainability and readability

3. **After Making Changes**
   - Verify guideline compliance
   - Explain changes clearly
   - Document any outstanding concerns

## Refactoring Guidelines

- Focus on optimization over extension
- Avoid introducing new features during refactoring
- Aim for cleaner, more maintainable code while preserving functionality
- Break up large changes into smaller, manageable pieces
- Use Git Bash syntax for running terminal commands

## Tech Stack & Process Details

- When working in the terminal, use Git Bash syntax
- Break large diffs into smaller, manageable pieces
- During refactoring, focus on optimization over extension
- Never spontaneously extend functionality in diffs unless explicitly requested
- Always create clear, descriptive commit messages that explain the purpose of changes
