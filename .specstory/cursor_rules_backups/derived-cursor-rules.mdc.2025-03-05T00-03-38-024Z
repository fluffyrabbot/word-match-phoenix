## PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project is a Discord bot built using Elixir and Phoenix LiveView, designed for a word-guessing game with multiple game modes.  The architecture employs event sourcing for persistence and CQRS for command handling.  The bot now handles both slash commands and message commands with a prefix. Message commands use the "!" prefix. DM guesses are passed verbatim.  Game sessions are managed using GenServers.  A new `GameBot.GameSessions.Session` GenServer manages each active game, delegating game logic to the appropriate game mode module.

## CODE STYLE
Adhere to Elixir's official style guide.  Use consistent indentation (2 spaces).  Keep functions concise and focused.  Favor descriptive variable and function names.  Commit messages should clearly describe the changes made. Edit diffs directly.


## FOLDER ORGANIZATION
The project follows a layered architecture:

- `game_bot`: Contains the main application code.
    - `lib/game_bot`: Core application logic.
        - `bot`: Discord bot integration layer.
            - `commands`: Command implementations (e.g., `game_commands.ex`).
            - `dispatcher.ex`: Routes incoming Discord events to appropriate handlers.
            - `listener.ex`: Listens for Discord events (e.g., using Nostrum).
        - `domain`: Core business logic and domain models (DDD, event sourcing).
            - `aggregates`: Aggregate roots (e.g., `team_aggregate.ex`, `user_aggregate.ex`).
            - `commands`: Command definitions and validation (CQRS command side).
                - `validation.ex`: Centralized command validation logic.
                - `game_commands.ex`: Game-specific command implementations.
        - `infrastructure`: Persistence and external service interactions.
            - `game_sessions`: Manages game sessions (GenServer implementation).
        - `game_sessions`: Manages game sessions (GenServer implementation).
    - `test`: Unit and integration tests.
- `nodedocs`:  Javascript documentation.
- `lib`: Libraries


## TECH STACK
- Elixir
- Phoenix LiveView
- PostgreSQL (EventStoreDB)
- Nostrum (Discord library)


## PROJECT-SPECIFIC STANDARDS
- Use event sourcing for persistence.
- Employ CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) for command handling.
- Maintain clear module boundaries.
- Follow consistent design patterns.
- One responsibility per module.
- Use either Registry or ETS for tracking active game sessions for performance. Use the database for persistent game history. Currently using ETS.  Migration to Registry planned upon implementation of GameBot.GameSessions.Session GenServer.

## WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES
- Use Git for version control.
- Create clear and concise commit messages.
- Follow a branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow).
- Implement a CI/CD pipeline.
- Edit diffs directly.


## REFERENCE EXAMPLES
- Refer to the `game_bot/lib/game_bot/bot/commands/game_commands.ex` file for a proper command handler structure.


## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM
- Documentation is maintained in Markdown format.
- Use SpecStory for tracking project decisions and progress.
- Update documentation to reflect the current state of the bot after major changes.  Relevant files include `summary_implementation_roadmap.md`, `structure.md`, `game_mode_roadmap.md`, and `detailed_implementation_roadmap.md`.  A new document `command_system.md` details the command handling architecture.  The `command_system.md` file now documents the dispatcher, command handler, and game commands. The `command_system.md` file now documents the dispatcher, command handler, and game commands.  The `command_system.md` file now documents the dispatcher, command handler, and game commands.

## DEBUGGING
- Use Elixir's built-in debugging tools (e.g., `iex`, `Logger`).
- Implement comprehensive logging.


## FINAL DOs AND DON'Ts
- **DO:** Keep functions concise and focused.
- **DO:** Use descriptive variable and function names.
- **DO:** Follow the layered architecture.
- **DO:** Maintain clear module boundaries.
- **DO:** Update documentation regularly.
- **DO:** Edit diffs directly.
- **DON'T:** Mix concerns within modules.
- **DON'T:** Create redundant components.
- **DON'T:** Neglect testing.
- **DO:** Slash commands are handled directly within the `dispatcher.ex` file. Message commands should use the "!" prefix and are handled by `command_handler.ex`. DM guesses should be passed verbatim and are handled by `command_handler.ex`.  The `dispatcher.ex` file routes raw Discord events to appropriate handlers. The `command_handler.ex` file handles message commands and routes them to appropriate command implementations.  The `dispatcher.ex` now also handles slash commands directly. Message commands use the "!" prefix. DM guesses are handled directly by passing them to `game_commands.ex`.  The `dispatcher` now handles all raw Discord events, routing slash commands to `GameCommands` and messages to `CommandHandler`. `CommandHandler` now focuses on message commands and DM guesses, using ETS for active game tracking.  DM guesses are passed verbatim to `GameCommands`. The dispatcher now handles both slash commands and message events, routing appropriately. The command handler now focuses exclusively on message commands and DM guesses, using an ETS table for active game tracking. DM guesses are passed verbatim to GameCommands.  The `dispatcher.ex` now handles both slash commands and message events, routing appropriately. The `command_handler.ex` now handles message commands and DM guesses, using an ETS table for active game tracking. DM guesses are passed verbatim to `GameCommands`.  The command handler now focuses exclusively on message commands and DM guesses.  DM guesses are passed verbatim to `GameCommands`.  The dispatcher now handles both slash commands and message events, routing appropriately.  The command handler now focuses exclusively on message commands and DM guesses, using an ETS table for active game tracking.  DM guesses are passed verbatim to GameCommands.

# Command System Architecture

## Overview

The command system is split into three layers:
1. Dispatcher (Entry Point)
2. Command Handler (Message Commands)
3. Game Commands (Implementation)

## Components

### Dispatcher (`GameBot.Bot.Dispatcher`)

The dispatcher is the entry point for all Discord events. It handles:

1. **Slash Commands** (directly routes to GameCommands):
   ```elixir
   /start [mode] [options]  # Start a new game
   /team create [options]   # Create team via slash command
   /guess [game_id] [word] # Submit guess via slash command
   ```

2. **Message Events**:
   - Routes all message events to CommandHandler
   - Maintains clean separation between Discord events and command processing

### Command Handler (`GameBot.Bot.CommandHandler`)

Handles text-based commands and DM interactions:

1. **Prefix Commands** (using "!" prefix):
   ```elixir
   !team @user  # Create team with mentioned user
   ```

2. **DM Guesses**:
   - Any message in a DM is treated as a guess
   - Uses ETS to track active games per user

3. **Active Game Tracking**:
   ```elixir
   # ETS table for fast user->game lookups
   @active_games_table :active_games

   # Public API
   set_active_game(user_id, game_id)    # Associate user with game
   clear_active_game(user_id)           # Remove user's game association
   ```

### Game Commands (`GameBot.Bot.Commands.GameCommands`)

Implementation layer that:
- Processes both slash commands and message commands
- Generates appropriate game events
- Handles core game logic

## Command Flow

1. **Slash Commands**:
   ```
   Discord → Dispatcher → GameCommands
   ```

2. **Message Commands**:
   ```
   Discord → Dispatcher → CommandHandler → GameCommands
   ```

3. **DM Guesses**:
   ```
   Discord → Dispatcher → CommandHandler → [ETS Lookup] → GameCommands
   ```

## Active Game State Management

Currently using ETS for active game tracking:

- **Table**: Named `:active_games`
- **Structure**: `{user_id, game_id}`
- **Access**: Public table for fast lookups
- **Lifecycle**: Initialized in CommandHandler.init/0

## Future Considerations

1. **Game Sessions**:
   - Planned to be implemented as GenServers
   - May switch from ETS to Registry when implemented
   - Could maintain both for different purposes:
     - ETS for fast lookups
     - Registry for process management

2. **Additional Commands**:
   - More prefix commands can be added in CommandHandler
   - More slash commands can be added in Dispatcher

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Need to implement proper error responses
   - Should add command validation
   - Consider adding rate limiting

## Command Reference

### Slash Commands
```elixir
/start
  mode: String    # Game mode to start
  options: Map    # Game configuration options

/team create
  name: String    # Team name
  players: List   # Player IDs

/guess
  game_id: String # ID of active game
  word: String    # Word to submit
```

### Message Commands
```elixir
!team @user       # Create team with mentioned user
```

### DM Commands
```elixir
any_text         # Treated as guess for active game
```
