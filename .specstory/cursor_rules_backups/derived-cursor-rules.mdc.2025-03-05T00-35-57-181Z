## PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project is a Discord bot built using Elixir and Phoenix LiveView, designed for a word-guessing game with multiple game modes.  The architecture employs event sourcing for persistence and CQRS for command handling.  The bot now handles both slash commands and message commands with a prefix. Message commands use the "!" prefix. DM guesses are passed verbatim.  Game sessions are managed using GenServers.  A new `GameBot.GameSessions.Session` GenServer manages each active game, delegating game logic to the appropriate game mode module.  The `GameBot.GameSessions.Supervisor` dynamically manages active game sessions. The `GameBot.GameSessions.Cleanup` GenServer periodically cleans up completed or abandoned game sessions.

## CODE STYLE
Adhere to Elixir's official style guide.  Use consistent indentation (2 spaces).  Keep functions concise and focused.  Favor descriptive variable and function names.  Commit messages should clearly describe the changes made. Edit diffs directly.


## FOLDER ORGANIZATION

## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM
- Documentation is maintained in Markdown format.
- Use SpecStory for tracking project decisions and progress.
- Update documentation to reflect the current state of the bot after major changes.  Relevant files include `summary_implementation_roadmap.md`, `structure.md`, `game_mode_roadmap.md`, and `detailed_implementation_roadmap.md`.  A new document `command_system.md` details the command handling architecture.  The `command_system.md` file now documents the dispatcher, command handler, and game commands. The `command_system.md` file now documents the dispatcher, command handler, and game commands.  The `command_system.md` file now documents the dispatcher, command handler, and game commands.  A new document `sessions.md` details the game session system architecture, implementation, and testing strategy.  The documentation for the command system and game sessions has been updated to reflect the latest changes.  The documentation has been updated to reflect the move of game commands to `game_commands.ex` and the removal of the redundant `command_router.ex` file.  The documentation for the command system and game sessions has been updated to reflect the latest changes.


## DEBUGGING
- Use Elixir's built-in debugging tools (e.g., `iex`, `Logger`).

Guess timeouts are removed as an unnecessary feature.

# Command System Architecture

## Overview

The command system is split into three layers:
1. Dispatcher (Entry Point)
2. Command Handler (Message Commands)
3. Game Commands (Implementation)

## Components

### Dispatcher (`GameBot.Bot.Dispatcher`)

The dispatcher is the entry point for all Discord events. It handles:

1. **Slash Commands** (directly routes to GameCommands):
   ```elixir
   /start [mode] [options]  # Start a new game
   /team create [options]   # Create team via slash command
   /guess [game_id] [word] # Submit guess via slash command
   ```

2. **Message Events**:
   - Routes all message events to CommandHandler
   - Maintains clean separation between Discord events and command processing

### Command Handler (`GameBot.Bot.CommandHandler`)

Handles text-based commands and DM interactions:

1. **Prefix Commands** (using "!" prefix):
   ```elixir
   !team @user  # Create team with mentioned user
   ```

2. **DM Guesses**:
   - Any message in a DM is treated as a guess
   - Uses ETS to track active games per user

3. **Active Game Tracking**:
   ```elixir
   # ETS table for fast user->game lookups
   @active_games_table :active_games

   # Public API
   set_active_game(user_id, game_id)    # Associate user with game
   clear_active_game(user_id)           # Remove user's game association
   ```

### Game Commands (`GameBot.Bot.Commands.GameCommands`)

Implementation layer that:
- Processes both slash commands and message commands
- Generates appropriate game events
- Handles core game logic

## Command Flow

1. **Slash Commands**:
   ```
   Discord → Dispatcher → GameCommands
   ```

2. **Message Commands**:
   ```
   Discord → Dispatcher → CommandHandler → GameCommands
   ```

3. **DM Guesses**:
   ```
   Discord → Dispatcher → CommandHandler → [ETS Lookup] → GameCommands
   ```

## Active Game State Management

Currently using ETS for active game tracking:

- **Table**: Named `:active_games`
- **Structure**: `{user_id, game_id}`
- **Access**: Public table for fast lookups
- **Lifecycle**: Initialized in CommandHandler.init/0

## Future Considerations

1. **Game Sessions**:
   - Implemented as GenServers
   - May switch from ETS to Registry in the future

2. **Additional Commands**:
    - More prefix commands can be added in CommandHandler
    - More slash commands can be added in Dispatcher

3. **Error Handling**:
    - Need to implement proper error responses
    - Should add command validation
    - Consider adding rate limiting

## Command Reference

### Slash Commands
```elixir
/start
  mode: String    # Game mode to start
  options: Map    # Game configuration options

/team create
  name: String    # Team name
  players: List   # Player IDs

/guess
  game_id: String # ID of active game
  word: String    # Word to submit
```

### Message Commands
```elixir
!team @user       # Create team with mentioned user
```

### DM Commands
```elixir
any_text         # Treated as guess for active game
```

# Game Session System

## Overview

The session system manages active game instances using GenServers, providing real-time state management and coordination between players. Each game session is a separate process that handles game state, player interactions, and game mode-specific logic.  The system employs event sourcing for state persistence and recovery.

## Core Components

### Session GenServer (`GameBot.GameSessions.Session`)

Manages individual game sessions with the following responsibilities:
- State management for active games
- Player registration and tracking
- Guess validation and processing
- Integration with game modes
- Event generation and handling

#### State Structure
```elixir
%{
  game_id: String.t(),         # Unique identifier for the game
  mode: module(),              # Game mode module (e.g., TwoPlayerMode)
  mode_state: GameState.t(),   # Current game state
  teams: %{String.t() => team_state()},  # Team states
  started_at: DateTime.t(),    # Session start timestamp
  status: :initializing | :active | :completed,  # Current session status
  guild_id: String.t(),         # Discord server ID
  round_timer_ref: reference() | nil,  # Reference to round check timer
  pending_events: [Event.t()] # Events pending persistence
}
```

### Session Supervisor (`GameBot.GameSessions.Supervisor`)

Dynamic supervisor that:
- Manages session lifecycle
- Handles session crashes
- Provides session lookup
- Manages cleanup of completed sessions

### Session Cleanup (`GameBot.GameSessions.Cleanup`)

Periodic cleanup process that:
- Removes completed/abandoned sessions
- Cleans up associated resources
- Maintains system health

## Key Interactions

1. **Game Mode Integration**
   ```elixir
   # Mode callbacks now return events
   @callback init(game_id, config) :: 
     {:ok, state, [Event.t()]} | {:error, term()}
   
   @callback process_guess_pair(state, team_id, guess_pair) :: 
     {:ok, new_state, [Event.t()]} | {:error, term()}
   
   @callback check_round_end(state) :: 
     {:round_end, winners, [Event.t()]} | :continue
   
   @callback check_game_end(state) :: 
     {:game_end, winners, [Event.t()]} | :continue
   @callback handle_round_end(state :: GameState.t(), winners :: [team_id()]) ::
     {:ok, new_state :: GameState.t(), events :: [Event.t()]}
   @callback start_new_round(state :: GameState.t()) ::
     {:ok, new_state :: GameState.t(), events :: [Event.t()]}
   ```

2. **Event Flow**
   ```elixir
   # Event handling flow
   handle_action()
   -> generate_events()
   -> persist_events()
   -> update_state()
   -> respond()
   ```

3. **Word Processing**
   ```elixir
   # Guess validation flow with events
   validate_guess(word)
   -> generate_validation_event()
   -> check_forbidden(word)
   -> record_guess(word)
   -> process_guess_pair()
   -> generate_result_event()
   -> persist_events()
   ```
