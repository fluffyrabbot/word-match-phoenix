@pipeline.ex @game_events.ex @metadata.ex @guess_events.ex @game_completed_validator.ex @event_validator.ex @event_serializer_map_impl.ex @error_events.ex fix the linter errors in each of these files, using small targeted diff edits

<think>
Let me analyze the files provided to identify linter errors. I'll go through each file and look for potential issues:

1. **pipeline.ex**
   - The file seems mostly well-structured
   - A potential issue is in the `broadcast` function where the result isn't always returned properly in the enhanced pubsub case

2. **metadata.ex**
   - This file appears well-structured
   - There are no obvious linter errors

3. **guess_events.ex**
   - The file appears well-structured with appropriate validation
   - No obvious linter errors

4. **game_completed_validator.ex**
   - Potential issue: unused variable `field` in functions

5. **event_validator.ex**
   - The file is a protocol definition with appropriate documentation
   - No obvious linter errors

6. **event_serializer_map_impl.ex**
   - Potential issues with unused variables in private functions
   - Some complex pattern matching that might need refinement

7. **error_events.ex**
   - The file appears well-structured with appropriate validation
   - No obvious linter errors

Let me now focus on the most likely linter errors:

1. In **pipeline.ex**, the `broadcast` function has a conditional branch that doesn't explicitly return a result. Adding a return statement would fix this.

2. In **game_completed_validator.ex**, there are unused variables named `field` in validation functions. We should use these variables or prefix them with underscore to indicate they're intentionally unused.

3. In **event_serializer_map_impl.ex**, there may be some pattern matching issues or unused variables to address.

Let's prepare the edits for each file based on these observations.

I'll review each file and make targeted edits to fix any linter errors I identify.

## 1. Pipeline.ex

Let me examine the `broadcast` function in the pipeline file:

---

_****_

Read file: undefined

_****_

Read file: undefined

_****_

I found the issue. In the `broadcast` function, when using enhanced pubsub, it doesn't return the result. Let's fix this:
