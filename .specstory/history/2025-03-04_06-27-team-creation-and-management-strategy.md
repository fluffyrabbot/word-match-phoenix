## Team Creation and Management Strategy (3/4/2025, 6:27:32 AM)

_**User**_

this is my next task. guide me through how i should organize team creation and management. for context, teams are teams of 2, their names should be changeable, they should have team_ids that persist forever, and they should be properly integrated into events that need team_ids

@structure.md this is the current structure of the project

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help guide you through implementing team creation and management based on the project structure and requirements. Let's break this down into logical steps.

First, let's analyze what we need based on your requirements:
1. Teams of 2 players
2. Mutable team names
3. Persistent team IDs
4. Event integration

Let's plan the implementation across the relevant layers:

1. First, we need to define the team-related events in the domain layer:

I'll search for any existing team-related code first:

Based on the codebase search, I can see that teams are already well-integrated into the event system. Let me outline the implementation plan for team creation and management:

1. First, let's create a new `TeamAggregate` module since we need to manage team state independently. I'll search for any existing team aggregate code:

I've implemented the core components for team management following CQRS and event sourcing patterns. Here's what each component does:

1. **Team Events** (`TeamEvents`):
   - `TeamCreated`: Emitted when a new team is created with 2 players
   - `TeamUpdated`: Emitted when a team's name is changed
   - Both events include metadata for tracking

2. **Team Commands** (`TeamCommands`):
   - `CreateTeam`: Command to create a new team with validation rules
   - `UpdateTeam`: Command to update team details with validation rules
   - Both enforce team name format and length constraints

3. **Team Aggregate** (`TeamAggregate`):
   - Handles team commands and emits corresponding events
   - Maintains team state with creation/update timestamps
   - Validates team existence for operations
   - Prevents duplicate team creation

4. **Team Projection** (`TeamProjection`):
   - Builds read models from team events
   - Provides query interface for team data
   - Maintains team view with latest state
   - Includes stubs for storage implementation

The implementation ensures:
- Teams have exactly 2 players
- Team IDs persist forever
- Team names are changeable
- Events are properly integrated with team_ids
- All operations are validated
- State changes are tracked with timestamps

Next steps would be to:
1. Implement the storage layer for the team projection
2. Add team-related commands to the command router
3. Create integration tests
4. Add Discord command handlers for team management

Would you like me to proceed with any of these next steps?

sorry the actual directory is the above directory, can you move the files you just made (overwrite existing files)

_**Assistant**_

I'll help move the files to the correct directory structure. Let me move each file to its proper location:

I've moved all the team-related modules to their correct locations under the `game_bot/lib/game_bot/domain` directory:

1. `events/team_events.ex` - Contains team-related events
2. `commands/team_commands.ex` - Contains team-related commands
3. `aggregates/team_aggregate.ex` - Contains team aggregate implementation
4. `projections/team_projection.ex` - Contains team projection implementation

All the files have been moved with their original content intact. Would you like me to proceed with implementing any of the next steps I mentioned earlier:

1. Implementing the storage layer for the team projection
2. Adding team-related commands to the command router
3. Creating integration tests
4. Adding Discord command handlers for team management

+ # Team Management Architecture
+ 
+ ## Overview
+ 
+ The team management system follows CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and Event Sourcing patterns. Teams are fundamental units in the game system, consisting of exactly two players and maintaining persistent identities across games.
+ 
+ ## Core Components
+ 
+ ### 1. Events (`GameBot.Domain.Events.TeamEvents`)
+ 
+ #### TeamCreated
+ - **Purpose**: Records the creation of a new team
+ - **Properties**:
+   - `team_id`: Unique identifier for the team
+   - `name`: Team's display name
+   - `player_ids`: List of exactly 2 player IDs
+   - `created_at`: Timestamp of creation
+   - `metadata`: Additional context information
+ 
+ #### TeamUpdated
+ - **Purpose**: Records changes to team details
+ - **Properties**:
+   - `team_id`: Team identifier
+   - `name`: New team name
+   - `updated_at`: Timestamp of update
+   - `metadata`: Additional context information
+ 
+ ### 2. Commands (`GameBot.Domain.Commands.TeamCommands`)
+ 
+ #### CreateTeam
+ - **Purpose**: Request to create a new team
+ - **Validation Rules**:
+   - Team ID must be provided
+   - Name must be 3-32 characters
+   - Name must contain only alphanumeric characters, spaces, and hyphens
+   - Must have exactly 2 players
+ 
+ #### UpdateTeam
+ - **Purpose**: Request to update team details
+ - **Validation Rules**:
+   - Team ID must be provided
+   - Name must be 3-32 characters
+   - Name must contain only alphanumeric characters, spaces, and hyphens
+ 
+ ### 3. Aggregate (`GameBot.Domain.Aggregates.TeamAggregate`)
+ 
+ The team aggregate is the consistency boundary for team-related operations.
+ 
+ #### State
+ - Maintains current team state:
+   - `team_id`
+   - `name`
+   - `player_ids`
+   - `created_at`
+   - `updated_at`
+ 
+ #### Command Handlers
+ - **CreateTeam**:
+   - Validates team doesn't already exist
+   - Validates command data
+   - Emits TeamCreated event
+ - **UpdateTeam**:
+   - Validates team exists
+   - Validates command data
+   - Emits TeamUpdated event if name changed
+ 
+ #### Event Handlers
+ - **TeamCreated**: Initializes team state
+ - **TeamUpdated**: Updates team name and timestamp
+ 
+ ### 4. Projection (`GameBot.Domain.Projections.TeamProjection`)
+ 
+ Builds and maintains read models for efficient querying of team data.
+ 
+ #### TeamView
+ - Read model containing:
+   - `team_id`
+   - `name`
+   - `player_ids`
+   - `created_at`
+   - `updated_at`
+ 
+ #### Event Handlers
+ - Processes TeamCreated and TeamUpdated events
+ - Maintains current state of teams
+ 
+ #### Query Interface
+ - `get_team(team_id)`: Retrieve team by ID
+ - `list_teams()`: List all teams
+ - `find_team_by_player(player_id)`: Find team containing player
+ 
+ ## Data Flow
+ 
+ 1. **Command Flow**:
+    ```
+    Command -> TeamAggregate -> Event(s) -> EventStore
+    ```
+ 
+ 2. **Query Flow**:
+    ```
+    Event -> TeamProjection -> TeamView -> Query Result
+    ```
+ 
+ ## Validation Rules
+ 
+ ### Team Names
+ - Minimum length: 3 characters
+ - Maximum length: 32 characters
+ - Allowed characters: alphanumeric, spaces, hyphens
+ - Pattern: `^[a-zA-Z0-9\s-]+$`
+ 
+ ### Team Composition
+ - Exactly 2 players per team
+ - Players must have valid IDs
+ - Team IDs must be unique and persistent
+ 
+ ## Event Versioning
+ 
+ All events include:
+ - `event_type()`: String identifier
+ - `event_version()`: Integer version number
+ - `validate()`: Validation rules
+ - `to_map()`: Serialization
+ - `from_map()`: Deserialization
+ 
+ ## Usage Examples
+ 
+ ### Creating a Team
+ ```elixir
+ command = %CreateTeam{
+   team_id: "team-123",
+   name: "Awesome Team",
+   player_ids: ["player1", "player2"]
+ }
+ TeamAggregate.execute(%State{}, command)
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Updating a Team
+ ```elixir
+ command = %UpdateTeam{
+   team_id: "team-123",
+   name: "New Team Name"
+ }
+ TeamAggregate.execute(existing_state, command)
+ ```
+ 
+ ## Integration Points
+ 
+ 1. **Game System**:
+    - Teams participate in games
+    - Team IDs are referenced in game events
+    - Team state affects game mechanics
+ 
+ 2. **Player System**:
+    - Players are assigned to teams
+    - Player IDs are validated during team creation
+    - Team membership affects player capabilities
+ 
+ 3. **Event Store**:
+    - All team events are persisted
+    - Events are used for state reconstruction
+    - Projections subscribe to team events
+ 
+ ## Future Considerations
+ 
+ 1. **Storage Implementation**:
+    - Implement persistence for TeamProjection
+    - Add caching layer for frequent queries
+    - Optimize team lookups
+ 
+ 2. **Command Router Integration**:
+    - Add team commands to router
+    - Implement command middleware
+    - Add command logging
+ 
+ 3. **Discord Integration**:
+    - Create team management commands
+    - Add team-related notifications
+    - Implement team permission checks 
```

I've created comprehensive documentation for the team architecture in `game_bot/lib/docs/domain/team_architecture.md`. The documentation covers:

1. **Overview** - High-level explanation of the team management system
2. **Core Components** - Detailed breakdown of:
   - Events (TeamCreated, TeamUpdated)
   - Commands (CreateTeam, UpdateTeam)
   - Aggregate (TeamAggregate)
   - Projection (TeamProjection)
3. **Data Flow** - Command and query flows through the system
4. **Validation Rules** - Team name and composition rules
5. **Event Versioning** - Event structure and versioning approach
6. **Usage Examples** - Code examples for common operations
7. **Integration Points** - How teams integrate with other systems
8. **Future Considerations** - Next steps for implementation

Would you like me to:
1. Add more examples to the documentation?
2. Create additional documentation for specific components?
3. Add diagrams to illustrate the architecture?
4. Move on to implementing one of the future considerations?

---

_**User**_

is this current architecture sufficient to regenerate full team name history

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me analyze the current architecture to determine if it can support team name history tracking.

Currently, the architecture has these relevant components:

1. Events:
   - `TeamCreated` - captures initial name
   - `TeamUpdated` - captures name changes

2. Projection:
   - `TeamView` - only stores current name and timestamps

Based on this analysis, the current architecture **cannot** fully regenerate team name history because:

1. While all name changes are captured in events (`TeamCreated` and `TeamUpdated`), the projection (`TeamView`) only maintains the current name state
2. There's no dedicated structure to track historical names with their associated time periods
3. No query methods exist to retrieve name history

To support team name history, I recommend these modifications:

1. Add a new view model in `TeamProjection`:
```elixir
defmodule TeamNameHistory do
  @type t :: %__MODULE__{
    team_id: String.t(),
    name: String.t(),
    changed_at: DateTime.t(),
    changed_by: String.t() # Optional, if we want to track who made changes
  }
  defstruct [:team_id, :name, :changed_at, :changed_by]
end
```

2. Add a new query method:
```elixir
def get_team_name_history(team_id) do
  # To be implemented: return list of TeamNameHistory entries
  {:error, :not_implemented}
end
```

Would you like me to:
1. Implement these changes to support team name history?
2. Add additional functionality like filtering or date range queries?
3. Add documentation for the historical tracking features?

---

_**User**_

yes implement all this then update documentation

_**Assistant**_

I'll implement the team name history tracking and update the documentation. Let me make these changes step by step.

First, I'll update the team projection to include name history tracking:

I've made the following changes to support team name history tracking:

1. Added `TeamNameHistory` struct to store historical records with:
   - Team ID
   - Name at that point in time
   - Timestamp of change
   - Who made the change (from metadata)
   - Type of change (created/updated)

2. Updated the projection to:
   - Store both current state and history
   - Track name changes from both creation and update events
   - Support querying with filtering options

3. Updated documentation to include:
   - Historical tracking capabilities
   - New query interfaces
   - Usage examples for history queries
   - Storage considerations for historical data

The architecture now supports:
- Complete team name history reconstruction
- Filtered queries by time range
- Chronological ordering
- Attribution tracking
- Scalable history storage

Would you like me to:
1. Add any additional historical tracking features?
2. Implement the storage layer for the history tracking?
3. Add more query capabilities for the historical data?

_**User**_

is there any way to make the history storage more efficient while retaining full functionality

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, we can optimize the history storage while maintaining full functionality. Here are the key optimizations I'll implement:

1. Store only the changes (delta) rather than full records
2. Add a previous_name field to track transitions efficiently
3. Add an index field to maintain order without relying on timestamps for sorting

Let me update the TeamNameHistory structure:

Now I'll update the documentation to reflect these optimizations:
