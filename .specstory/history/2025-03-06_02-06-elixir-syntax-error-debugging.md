## Elixir Syntax Error Debugging (3/6/2025, 2:06:17 AM)

@listener_test.exs search this file for syntax errors. the linter says it's the final end that causes the error but i suspect it's due to do block formatting somewhere

You are correct, the issue is not the final `end` but rather a missing `end` within the `setup` block. Specifically, the `rescue` clause is missing its corresponding `end`.

Here's the corrected `setup` block:

```elixir:game_bot/test/game_bot/bot/listener_test.exs
  # We need to clean up the ETS tables between tests
  setup do
    # Create or clear rate limit table
    :ets.new(:rate_limit_store, [:named_table, :public])
    rescue
      ArgumentError -> :ets.delete_all_objects(:rate_limit_store)
    end # <- This 'end' was missing

    # Initialize CommandHandler and its ETS table
    if :ets.whereis(:active_games) == :undefined do
      CommandHandler.init()
    end
    :ets.delete_all_objects(:active_games)

    # Reset error simulation before each test
    NostrumApiMock.simulate_error(false)

    on_exit(fn ->
      # Only try to clean up tables if they exist
      if :ets.whereis(:rate_limit_store) != :undefined do
        :ets.delete_all_objects(:rate_limit_store)
      end
      if :ets.whereis(:active_games) != :undefined do
        :ets.delete_all_objects(:active_games)
      end
      NostrumApiMock.simulate_error(false)
    end)

    :ok
  end
```
I've added a comment to highlight the added `end`. This resolves the syntax error.
