## Fixing TokenMissingError in Elixir Code (3/6/2025, 10:47:58 PM)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
** (TokenMissingError) token missing on game_bot/lib/game_bot/bot/commands/game_commands.ex:245:9:
     error: missing terminator: """ (for heredoc starting at line 240)
     │
 240 │   @doc """
     │        └ unclosed delimiter
 ...
 245 │     * `
     │         └ missing closing delimiter (expected """)
     │
     └─ game_bot/lib/game_bot/bot/commands/game_commands.ex:245:9
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

The error message `TokenMissingError` indicates that a multi-line string (heredoc) opened with `"""` was not closed. Looking at line 240, the `@doc """` starts a documentation string, and the error message points to line 245 within that docstring, and specifically mentions the missing closing `"""`. The code snippet you provided is truncated, so we can't see where it *should* close, but the error tells us exactly what's wrong: we need to close the docstring. The next function definition will be after the end of the docstring.

```game_bot/lib/game_bot/bot/commands/game_commands.ex
  @doc """
  Gets partner info for a player in a game.
  Returns the information about the player's partner in the current team.

  ## Parameters
    * `
""" # <- Add the closing triple quotes here.
  def get_partner_info(game, player_info) do
    # ... existing code ...
```
