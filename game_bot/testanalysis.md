# Test Analysis - `test_output.txt`

This document analyzes the output of the test suite, categorizing failures and warnings by priority and suggesting potential fixes.

## High Priority - Test Failures Blocking Core Functionality

These failures indicate significant problems that likely prevent the core game logic or infrastructure from working correctly.  They should be addressed first.

1.  **Event Store/Repo Not Started (Multiple Tests)**

    *   **Examples:**
        *   `integration_test.exs:209`:  `could not lookup Ecto repo GameBot.Infrastructure.Persistence.EventStore.Adapter.Postgres because it was not started or it does not exist`
        *   `integration_test.exs:230`: (Same error)
        *   `transaction_test.exs:269`: `could not lookup Ecto repo GameBot.Infrastructure.Persistence.Repo.Postgres because it was not started or it does not exist`
        *   `adapter_test.exs:47`, `adapter_test.exs:62`, `adapter_test.exs:76`: `MatchError` with `{:error, {:already_started, #PID<...>}}`

    *   **Problem:**  The most critical issue is that several tests fail because the `EventStore.Adapter.Postgres` or `Repo.Postgres` Ecto repositories are not started or cannot be found. This suggests a problem with the test setup, database connection, or application startup. The `already_started` errors in `AdapterTest` indicate a possible issue with test setup/teardown where the adapter is being started multiple times.

    *   **Possible Causes:**
        *   The test environment isn't correctly starting the necessary applications (e.g., `GameBot.Infrastructure.Persistence.Repo`, `GameBot.Infrastructure.Persistence.EventStore`).
        *   The database configuration for the test environment is incorrect (e.g., wrong hostname, port, credentials).
        *   The test setup is not waiting for the repositories to be fully initialized before running tests.
        *   The `AdapterTest` is not properly cleaning up resources between test runs, leading to conflicts.

    *   **Suggested Fixes:**
        *   **Verify Application Startup:** Ensure that the test helper (`test/test_helper.exs` or similar) correctly starts the required applications, including the Ecto repos, *before* running any tests.  Use `Application.ensure_all_started/1` or `Application.start/1` as appropriate.
        *   **Check Database Configuration:** Double-check the database configuration for the `test` environment (likely in `config/test.exs`). Ensure the connection parameters are correct and that the test database is running.
        *   **Add Start Delays (Temporary):** As a *temporary* debugging measure, you could add short delays (e.g., `Process.sleep(500)`) after starting the applications to give them time to initialize.  This is *not* a long-term solution, but it can help isolate the problem.
        *   **Review Test Setup/Teardown:**  Carefully examine the `setup` and `on_exit` blocks in the failing test modules (especially `AdapterTest`). Ensure that resources are properly cleaned up after each test and that there are no conflicting setup operations.  Consider using `ExUnit.Callbacks.setup_all/2` for one-time setup if appropriate.
        *   **DatabaseManager:** The errors related to `GameBot.Test.DatabaseManager` and `setup_sandbox_mode` (lines 200-202) suggest a problem with the test sandbox setup.  Investigate `lib/game_bot/test/database_manager.ex` to ensure it's correctly handling the sandbox mode and that the `Enumerable` protocol is implemented for the value being passed.

2.  **GenServer Call Timeout (Line 94)**

    *   **Example:** `[error] Task #PID<0.1020.0> started from #PID<0.897.0> terminating ... ** (stop) exited in: GenServer.call(GameBot.TestEventStore, {:append_to_stream, ...}, 5000)` followed by `(EXIT) no process`.

    *   **Problem:** A `GenServer.call` to `GameBot.TestEventStore` is timing out and then the process is not found. This indicates that the event store is either crashing, taking too long to respond, or not being started correctly. This is likely related to the "Event Store Not Started" issue above.

    *   **Possible Causes:**
        *   The `GameBot.TestEventStore` GenServer is crashing during the `:append_to_stream` operation.
        *   The operation is taking longer than the 5-second timeout.
        *   The `TestEventStore` is not started or is not registered under the expected name.

    *   **Suggested Fixes:**
        *   **Address Event Store Startup:**  Prioritize fixing the "Event Store Not Started" issue, as this is likely the root cause.
        *   **Inspect `TestEventStore`:** Examine the `GameBot.TestEventStore` code (if it's custom) to see why the `:append_to_stream` call might be failing or taking a long time. Add logging to help diagnose the issue.
        *   **Increase Timeout (Temporary):**  As a temporary measure, you could increase the timeout in the `GenServer.call` (currently 5000ms) to see if it's simply a matter of the operation taking longer than expected.  However, this should not be a permanent fix.
        *   **Check for Deadlocks:** If the `TestEventStore` interacts with other GenServers, there's a possibility of deadlocks.  Carefully review the interactions between processes.

3.  **Simulated Crash in TestEventHandler (Line 152)**

    *   **Example:** `[error] GenServer GameBot.Domain.Events.HandlerTest.TestEventHandler terminating ** (RuntimeError) simulated crash`

    *   **Problem:** While this is a "simulated crash," it's important to understand *why* it's occurring and whether the error handling is working as expected.  It *might* be intentional, but it's worth investigating.

    *   **Possible Causes:**
        *   The test is intentionally simulating a crash to test error handling.
        *   There's an unexpected condition in the `TestEventHandler` that's triggering the crash.

    *   **Suggested Fixes:**
        *   **Review Test Intent:** Examine the `GameBot.Domain.Events.HandlerTest.TestEventHandler` and the associated test to understand if the crash is intentional. If so, ensure the test is correctly verifying the expected error handling behavior.
        *   **Add Assertions:** If the crash is intentional, add assertions to the test to verify that the system handles the crash gracefully (e.g., that the error is logged, that the GenServer is restarted if necessary, etc.).
        *   **Investigate Unexpected Crash:** If the crash is *not* intentional, investigate the `TestEventHandler` code to determine the cause and fix it.

## Medium Priority - Test Failures in Specific Game Logic

These failures indicate problems with specific game mechanics or components, but don't necessarily block the entire system.

1.  **WordServiceTest Failures (Lines 114, 123, 134, 145)**

    *   **Examples:**
        *   `test matches US/UK spelling variations`: `Expected truthy, got false`
        *   `test returns variations of a word`: `Assertion with in failed`
        *   `test combines variations from file and pattern-based rules`: `Assertion with in failed`
        *   `test matches words using both file and pattern-based variations`: `Expected truthy, got false`

    *   **Problem:**  The `WordService` is not correctly handling word variations (US/UK spellings, pluralization, etc.). This suggests issues with the word list, the matching logic, or the variation generation rules.

    *   **Possible Causes:**
        *   The word list (`words.txt` or similar) is missing required variations.
        *   The regular expressions or other logic used to generate variations are incorrect or incomplete.
        *   The `match?` function in `WordService` has a bug in its comparison logic.

    *   **Suggested Fixes:**
        *   **Expand Word List:**  Carefully review and expand the `words.txt` file (or the source of your word data) to include all necessary US and UK spelling variations, plurals, and other forms.
        *   **Refine Variation Rules:**  Examine the code in `WordService` that generates word variations (likely using regular expressions).  Ensure the rules are comprehensive and correct.  Consider using a dedicated library for stemming/lemmatization if appropriate.
        *   **Correct `match?` Logic:**  Debug the `WordService.match?` function to ensure it correctly compares words, taking into account the generated variations.  Consider using a case-insensitive comparison and potentially normalizing the input words before comparison.
        *   **Add More Specific Tests:** Add more test cases to `WordServiceTest` to cover a wider range of word variations and edge cases.

2.  **Replay Storage Test Failures (Lines 880, 894, 908, 921, 933, 945)**

    *   **Examples:**
        *   `test list_replays/1 lists replays with default params`: `ArgumentError: not a list`
        *   `test list_replays/1 lists replays with filters`: `ArgumentError: not a list`
        *   `test list_replays/1 returns empty list when no replays match filters`: `Assertion with == failed`
        *   `test log_access/6 returns error on failed insert`: `match (=) failed`
        *   `test cleanup_old_replays/1 deletes old replays`: `Assertion with == failed`
        *   `test cleanup_old_replays/1 handles delete errors`: `match (=) failed`

    *   **Problem:** The replay storage functionality is not working correctly.  This could be due to issues with database interactions, data serialization, or the replay logic itself. The `ArgumentError: not a list` errors are particularly concerning, suggesting a type mismatch. The failures related to `list_replays` returning `{:ok, []}` instead of `[]` indicate a misunderstanding of the expected return type.

    *   **Possible Causes:**
        *   Database connection problems (similar to the High Priority issues).
        *   Incorrect Ecto schema definitions for the replay data.
        *   Errors in the `list_replays`, `log_access`, or `cleanup_old_replays` functions.
        *   Mismatched expectations about return types (e.g., expecting a list when a tuple is returned).

    *   **Suggested Fixes:**
        *   **Address Database Issues:**  First, ensure the High Priority database connection problems are resolved.
        *   **Review Ecto Schemas:**  Carefully examine the Ecto schemas related to replays to ensure they correctly represent the data.
        *   **Correct Function Logic:**  Debug the `list_replays`, `log_access`, and `cleanup_old_replays` functions in `GameBot.Replay.StorageTest` and the corresponding implementation code.  Pay close attention to error handling and data transformations.
        *   **Fix Return Type Expectations:**  In `GameBot.Replay.StorageTest`, change the assertions to correctly handle the `{:ok, list}` return type. For example, instead of `assert length(list) == 2`, use `assert {:ok, result} = Storage.list_replays(...); assert length(result) == 2`.  Similarly, change `assert list == []` to `assert {:ok, []} = Storage.list_replays(...)`.
        *   **Add More Logging:** Add logging to the replay storage functions to help track down the source of the errors.

## Low Priority - Warnings and Minor Issues

These issues are less critical but should be addressed to improve code quality and prevent potential problems.

1.  **Event Store Not Running Warnings (Multiple Lines)**

    *   **Examples:** `[warning] Event store is not running, cannot reset` (Lines 876, 891, 905, 917, 918, 929, 942, 956)

    *   **Problem:**  These warnings indicate that the test suite is trying to reset the event store, but it's not running. This is likely a consequence of the High Priority event store startup issues.

    *   **Suggested Fixes:**
        *   **Fix Event Store Startup:**  Addressing the High Priority issues related to the event store will likely resolve these warnings.
        *   **Conditional Reset:**  Consider adding a check to see if the event store is running *before* attempting to reset it. This would prevent the warnings, but it's less important than fixing the underlying startup problem.

2.  **Invalid Event Format Warning (Line 104)**

    *   **Example:** `[warning] Invalid event format for version validation: %{foo: "bar"}`

    *   **Problem:**  An event with an invalid format (`%{foo: "bar"}`) is being passed for version validation. This suggests a problem with a test case or with the event validation logic itself.

    *   **Suggested Fixes:**
        *   **Review Test Data:**  Examine the test that's generating this warning and ensure that the event data being used is valid.
        *   **Improve Validation Logic:**  If the invalid format is intentional (for testing error handling), make sure the validation logic correctly handles such cases and doesn't produce unnecessary warnings.  Consider adding a specific test for invalid event formats.

3.  **Error Processing Event (Line 107)**

    *   **Example:** `[error] Error processing event with version 1: %RuntimeError{message: "Test exception"}`

    *   **Problem:** This indicates an error during event processing, likely related to event translation or migration. The "Test exception" suggests it might be part of a test, but it's worth investigating.

    *   **Suggested Fixes:**
        *   **Review Test Setup:** Check the test related to `EventTranslatorTest` and `TestMigrations` to see if this error is expected. If it is, add assertions to verify the correct error handling.
        *   **Investigate Migration Logic:** If the error is not expected, examine the migration functions (e.g., `TestMigrations.v1_to_v2`) to see if there's a bug in the migration logic.

4. **`Game start event not found` (line 954)**
    * **Problem:** This suggests an issue in calculating base stats because a necessary `GameStarted` event is missing.
    * **Suggested Fix:** Ensure that the test setup correctly creates and persists a `GameStarted` event before attempting to calculate base stats.

5. **Exit when stopping Repo (line 955)**
    * **Problem:** This warning indicates a potential issue with how the `GameBot.Infrastructure.Persistence.Repo` is being stopped.
    * **Suggested Fix:** Review the shutdown process for the Repo and ensure it's being handled gracefully. This might involve checking the supervision tree and ensuring proper cleanup.

## Summary of Actions

1.  **Prioritize:** Focus on the High Priority issues first. These are blocking the core functionality of the tests.
2.  **Database:** Ensure the test database is running and accessible, and that the test environment is correctly configured to connect to it.
3.  **Application Startup:** Verify that the test helper correctly starts all necessary applications, including the Ecto repositories.
4.  **Test Setup/Teardown:** Carefully review the `setup` and `on_exit` blocks in the failing test modules.
5.  **Word Service:** Address the issues with word variation matching in the `WordService`.
6.  **Replay Storage:** Fix the replay storage logic and update assertions to match expected return types.
7.  **Logging:** Add more logging to help diagnose issues, especially in the event store and replay storage.
8. **Review Warnings:** Address the warnings once the major failures are resolved.

By systematically addressing these issues, you should be able to resolve the test failures and improve the overall stability and reliability of the GameBot codebase.
