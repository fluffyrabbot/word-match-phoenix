### 6. Process Monitoring

‚úÖ **Improved Process Monitoring**

- Implemented proper cleanup of monitored processes
- Ensured test processes are properly terminated
- Added logs for debugging process lifecycle

### 7. Function Consistency

‚úÖ **Fixed Function Naming and Parameter Consistency**

### 8. Test Execution Flow

‚úÖ **Fixed Test Execution Ordering**
- Removed direct ExUnit.run() call in test_helper.exs

- Let Mix handle the test execution naturally
- Properly set up after_suite cleanup hooks

### 9. Test Environment Setup

‚úÖ **Improved Test Environment Setup**
- Added setup_sandbox/1 function to properly replace missing functionality
- Improved event store initialization and error handling
- Added better process state validation before operations
- Updated sandbox checkout handling to include timeout and async support

## Diagnostic Test Results

Our updated diagnostic tests now run with significantly fewer errors, though some issues remain:

1. ‚úÖ Basic environment verification
2. ‚úÖ PostgreSQL connection testing
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Repository initialization testing - Some repositories not starting properly
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è EventStore mock functionality testing - Issues with event serialization

The improved implementation:
- Handles already-running EventStoreCore instances
- Properly delegates between interfaces and core implementations
- Correctly manages process registration/deregistration
- Properly handles different return formats from operations
- Includes comprehensive error handling

## Current Status

The test infrastructure has been significantly improved with:
1. Proper behavior separation for both TestEventStore and EventStoreMock
2. Robust process management and error handling
3. Consistent function naming and parameters
4. Better test environment initialization

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Test Environment Initialization Issues üî¥

The most critical remaining issue is inconsistent test environment initialization:
- Many tests fail because repositories are not properly started or connected
- The EventStore processes are not always initialized in the correct order
- Some tests expect processes to be initialized, others initialize them themselves
- Repository checkout timings cause race conditions in some tests

### 2. Mock Implementation and Availability Issues üî¥

Several tests fail because they can't find or load mock modules:
- Missing `MockEventStoreAccess` and `MockSubscriptionManager` modules
- Inconsistent mock initialization and teardown procedures
- Some tests trying to use Mox with undefined mocks
- Mock return values don't match expected formats in some cases

### 3. Event Serialization Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

Some integration tests fail due to event serialization problems:
- Event structures don't meet validation requirements
- Events missing required type keys during serialization
- Inconsistent expectations about event formats between tests
- Different implementations handling event formats differently

### 4. Code Quality Warnings ‚ö†Ô∏è

There are still multiple warnings in the application code that need attention:
- Unused variables and aliases
- Functions with multiple clauses that have conflicting defaults
- Missing `@impl` annotations in behavior implementations
- Private functions with `@doc` attributes causing documentation loss

### 5. Test Result Format Inconsistencies ‚ö†Ô∏è

Some tests expect different return formats than the implementations provide:
- Some expect raw lists rather than {:ok, list} tuples
- Others expect structs rather than maps in return values
- Return format expectations vary between tests for the same functions
- Inconsistent error handling expectations between test modules

## Next Steps (Prioritized)

### 1. Fix Test Environment Initialization Issues üî¥

- Update the repository case module to consistently initialize repositories
- Create a standard pre-test environment validation process
- Ensure consistent startup sequence across all test modules
- Add better error handling for initialization failures

### 2. Create Missing Mock Implementations üî¥

- Create and implement missing mock modules:
  - `MockEventStoreAccess` with required callbacks
  - `MockSubscriptionManager` with required callbacks
- Update test modules to properly initialize mocks
- Standardize mock setup and teardown procedures
- Add comprehensive error handling for mock operations

### 3. Fix Event Serialization Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Update test event creation helpers to ensure proper format
- Add validation to catch invalid event formats early
- Create standard event factory functions for tests
- Document required event formats for all implementations

### 4. Address Code Quality Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Fix unused variables by prefixing with underscore
- Remove or properly use unused aliases
- Fix function clause conflicts
- Add missing `@impl` annotations
- Fix private function documentation

### 5. Standardize Test Expectations ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Update test expectations to match actual implementation return formats
- Create helper functions for result validation
- Document expected return formats for all functions
- Add type specifications to clarify expected formats

## Conclusion

We've made substantial progress fixing the critical issues in the test infrastructure, particularly with the EventStore behavior separation and function consistency improvements. The remaining issues are primarily related to test environment initialization, mock implementation, and integration with the existing test suite.

By addressing the prioritized issues above, we can complete the test infrastructure improvements and provide a much more robust and maintainable testing environment for GameBot.
