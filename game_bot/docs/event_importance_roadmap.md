# Event Importance Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the steps needed to fully implement event importance handling across the GameBot system. While the current implementation categorizes events for metadata optimization, a comprehensive approach requires integration with other system components.

## Current Implementation Status

- [x] Basic event categorization in `MetadataOptimizer.categorize_event/2`
- [x] Metadata optimization based on event importance
- [x] Configuration for retention policies based on event types
- [x] Compression strategies that consider event importance

## Critical Events Classification

The following events are classified as **CRITICAL** and should receive full metadata treatment:

- [x] `game_started` - Initial game setup
- [x] `game_ended` - Game completion
- [x] `player_joined` - Player joining a game
- [x] `player_left` - Player leaving a game
- [x] `game_aborted` - Game cancellation
- [x] `team_eliminated` - Team elimination
- [x] `guess_processed` - Complete guess attempt processing

Critical events are essential for:
- Game state reconstruction
- Player progression tracking
- Analytics and reporting
- Audit trail requirements

## Phase 1: Core Event Importance Framework

- [ ] Create an `EventImportance` module with standardized importance levels
  - [ ] Define importance enum `:critical | :important | :frequent | :system`
  - [ ] Document the criteria for each importance level
  - [ ] Create helper functions for importance comparison

- [ ] Enhance event structs to include importance field
  - [ ] Add `importance` field to event structs
  - [ ] Update event validation to check importance field
  - [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with existing events

- [ ] Implement importance inference for events without explicit importance
  - [ ] Create rules engine for determining importance from event content
  - [ ] Add fallback importance based on event type

## Phase 2: Storage and Persistence Integration

- [ ] Update event serialization to include importance
  - [ ] Add importance to serialized event format
  - [ ] Ensure importance is preserved during deserialization
  - [ ] Add migration path for existing events

- [ ] Implement importance-based storage strategies
  - [ ] Create storage partitioning based on importance
  - [ ] Implement tiered storage backends (hot/warm/cold)
  - [ ] Add configuration options for storage tiers

- [ ] Enhance retention policies with importance-based rules
  - [ ] Create dynamic retention calculator based on importance and context
  - [ ] Implement automated cleanup of low-importance events
  - [ ] Add importance override capabilities for special cases

## Phase 3: Query and Retrieval Enhancements

- [ ] Add importance-based filtering to event queries
  - [ ] Create query parameters for importance filtering
  - [ ] Optimize query performance for importance-based filters
  - [ ] Add importance-based sorting options

- [ ] Implement importance-aware event aggregation
  - [ ] Create aggregation strategies for different importance levels
  - [ ] Implement automatic summarization of low-importance events
  - [ ] Preserve critical events during aggregation

- [ ] Add importance-based access control
  - [ ] Define access policies based on event importance
  - [ ] Implement permission checks for event access
  - [ ] Add audit logging for access to critical events

## Phase 4: Runtime and Operational Features

- [ ] Implement importance-based rate limiting
  - [ ] Create rate limiting rules based on event importance
  - [ ] Add backpressure mechanisms for high-frequency events
  - [ ] Ensure critical events are never dropped

- [ ] Add importance-aware monitoring and alerting
  - [ ] Create importance-based metrics and dashboards
  - [ ] Implement alerting thresholds based on importance
  - [ ] Add anomaly detection for unusual importance patterns

- [ ] Implement importance-based routing
  - [ ] Create routing rules based on event importance
  - [ ] Implement priority queues for event processing
  - [ ] Add dedicated processing for critical events

## Phase 5: User Interface and Developer Experience

- [ ] Add importance visualization in admin interfaces
  - [ ] Create color coding for different importance levels
  - [ ] Implement importance-based filtering in UIs
  - [ ] Add importance statistics and trends

- [ ] Enhance logging with importance context
  - [ ] Add importance to log entries
  - [ ] Implement importance-based log levels
  - [ ] Create importance-aware log rotation policies

- [ ] Create developer tools for importance management
  - [ ] Add importance validation in test frameworks
  - [ ] Create documentation generators for importance rules
  - [ ] Implement importance analysis tools for codebase

## Implementation Guidelines

### Importance Level Criteria

When assigning importance to events, consider these factors:

1. **Business Impact**: How critical is this event to core game functionality?
2. **Data Value**: How valuable is this event for analytics and debugging?
3. **Frequency**: How often does this event occur during normal operation?
4. **User Visibility**: Is this event directly visible to users?
5. **Recovery Requirements**: How important is this event for system recovery?

### Backward Compatibility

Ensure all changes maintain backward compatibility:

- Events without explicit importance should receive a default based on type
- Existing code that doesn't handle importance should continue to work
- Storage formats should be versioned to handle importance field addition

### Performance Considerations

Be mindful of performance impacts:

- Importance determination should be fast (< 0.1ms)
- Storage optimizations should not significantly impact write performance
- Query optimizations should improve read performance for common patterns

## Success Metrics

The successful implementation of event importance handling will be measured by:

1. **Storage Efficiency**: 50%+ reduction in storage for low-importance events
2. **Query Performance**: 30%+ improvement in query times for important events
3. **System Reliability**: Zero data loss for critical events
4. **Developer Productivity**: Simplified event handling code with clear importance rules
5. **Operational Visibility**: Improved monitoring and alerting based on event importance

## Timeline

- Phase 1: 2 weeks
- Phase 2: 3 weeks
- Phase 3: 2 weeks
- Phase 4: 2 weeks
- Phase 5: 1 week

Total estimated time: 10 weeks
