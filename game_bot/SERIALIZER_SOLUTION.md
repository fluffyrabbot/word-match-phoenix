# Serializer Solution Summary

## Problem Analysis

1. The tests were looking for `GameBot.Infrastructure.Persistence.EventStore.JsonSerializer`, but the actual implementation was at `GameBot.Infrastructure.Persistence.EventStore.Serialization.JsonSerializer`.

2. Some tests were using unqualified `Serializer.event_version/1` calls, which couldn't be resolved.

3. There were two competing serializer implementations:
   - `GameBot.Infrastructure.Persistence.EventStore.Serializer` - a simpler version
   - `GameBot.Infrastructure.Persistence.EventStore.Serialization.JsonSerializer` - a more robust implementation 

4. The serializer implementations had different function signatures:
   - `Serializer.deserialize/1` vs. `JsonSerializer.deserialize/2`
   - Different error types and handling

## Solution Implemented

1. Created an alias module at `game_bot/lib/game_bot/infrastructure/persistence/event_store/json_serializer.ex` that:
   - Delegates to the full implementation
   - Handles different function signatures (e.g., optional second parameter for deserialize)
   - Converts error types for compatibility

2. Updated the old `Serializer` module to delegate all calls to `JsonSerializer`, with:
   - Deprecated warnings in documentation
   - Compatible function signatures
   - Same behavior for tests

3. Updated test files to use the fully-qualified module name with `alias`:
   - `alias GameBot.Infrastructure.Persistence.EventStore.Serializer` for tests

4. Fixed references in documentation to use the standardized module names.

## Benefits

1. Tests will now pass without changing the implementations
2. Clear migration path:
   - In the short term: old code still works
   - In the medium term: update references to use the JsonSerializer 
   - In the long term: remove the duplicate serializer code

3. Standardized on one serializer implementation instead of two

## Potential Blind Spots to Watch For

1. **Behavior Compatibility**: There might be subtle differences in how the original `Serializer` module handled certain edge cases compared to the `JsonSerializer` implementation.

2. **Performance Impact**: The delegation approach adds a layer of indirection that could slightly impact performance in critical paths.

3. **Error Types**: While we tried to maintain compatible error types, there might be some edge cases where code expects specific error structures.

4. **Documentation Updates**: There might be other documentation or examples not found in the codebase that need updating.

5. **Extension Points**: Any code that extends these modules (like tests that depend on specific internal behavior) might need updates.
