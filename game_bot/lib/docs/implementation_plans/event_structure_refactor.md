# Event Structure Refactor Implementation Plan

## Current Status
✅ Core infrastructure is complete and working
✅ Event serialization and validation is implemented
✅ Base event structure and behavior is defined
✅ Example event implementation is fixed and working
✅ Game events are implemented
✅ Benchmark suite is implemented

## Completed Items

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- ✅ Implement `GameBot.Domain.Events.Types` module
- ✅ Create `GameBot.Domain.Events.Builder` module
- ✅ Implement `GameBot.Domain.Events.Pipeline` module
- ✅ Fix example event implementation to properly use BaseEvent
- ✅ Add benchmark suite for event processing

### Phase 2: Event Implementation
- ✅ Implement GameStarted event
- ✅ Implement GameCompleted event
- ✅ Implement RoundStarted event
- ✅ Implement TeamEliminated event
- ✅ Add comprehensive test coverage

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization
- ✅ Add benchmark suite
- ✅ Implement caching layer
- ✅ Add telemetry integration

## Next Steps

1. Run the benchmark suite to establish baseline performance metrics
2. Review and optimize any bottlenecks identified by benchmarks
3. Consider implementing additional events as needed for new game features

## Notes

### Event Structure
All events now follow a consistent structure using the BaseEvent behavior:
- Common fields (game_id, guild_id, mode, round_number, timestamp, metadata)
- Custom fields defined through the `fields` option in `use BaseEvent`
- Validation through `validate_custom_fields/1` callback
- Serialization handled by the BaseEvent implementation

### Example Event
The example event has been updated to:
- Use proper field definitions with BaseEvent
- Include all required base fields
- Demonstrate proper validation
- Show correct usage of the event system

### Performance
The benchmark suite is ready to measure:
- Event validation speed
- Serialization/deserialization performance
- End-to-end event processing time

### Testing
All events have comprehensive test coverage including:
- Validation of required fields
- Serialization roundtrip tests
- Error handling scenarios
