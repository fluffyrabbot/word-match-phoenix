# Game Mode Enhancement Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for enhancing the Game Modes, focusing on completing event handling, implementing state recovery, and adding comprehensive testing. Game Modes define the rules and behavior for different gameplay variations within the GameBot system.

## Current Status

- ✅ `GameBot.Domain.GameModes.BaseMode` behavior defined
- ✅ Two Player Mode core implementation complete
- ✅ Knockout Mode core implementation complete
- 🔶 Partial event handling in base mode
- 🔶 Partial event generation in game modes
- ❌ Missing state recovery for game modes
- ❌ Missing integration tests
- ❌ Missing Race Mode implementation

## Implementation Goals

1. Complete Two Player Mode event handling
2. Enhance Knockout Mode implementation
3. Begin Race Mode implementation
4. Add state recovery to all modes
5. Implement comprehensive testing

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### 1. Two Player Mode Enhancement (3 days)

#### 1.1 Event Handling Completion
- [ ] Review existing event generation

  - [ ] `handle_round_start/2`
  - [ ] `handle_round_end/2`
  - [ ] `handle_player_timeout/2`
  - [ ] `handle_match_success/2`
  - [ ] `handle_game_end/2`
- [ ] Add event validation for all handlers
- [ ] Ensure proper event sequencing

#### 1.2 State Management Improvement
- [ ] Refine state transitions
- [ ] Add comprehensive validation
- [ ] Implement state consistency checks
- [ ] Create proper error handling

#### 1.3 State Recovery Implementation

- [ ] Create game end events
- [ ] Implement player status events

#### 2.2 Elimination Tracking
- [ ] Add player elimination logic
- [ ] Implement team elimination
- [ ] Create elimination conditions
- [ ] Add elimination notifications

#### 2.3 Round Management
- [ ] Implement round transitions
- [ ] Add round scoring
- [ ] Create round summary events
- [ ] Implement progressive difficulty

#### 2.4 State Recovery
- [ ] Create state rebuild function
- [ ] Implement elimination state recovery
- [ ] Add round state reconstruction
- [ ] Create comprehensive validation

### 3. Race Mode Implementation (5 days)

#### 3.1 Core Implementation
- [ ] Create `GameBot.Domain.GameModes.RaceMode` module
- [ ] Implement the BaseMode behavior
- [ ] Add race-specific state structure
- [ ] Create race initialization logic

#### 3.2 Race Mechanics
- [ ] Implement progress tracking
- [ ] Add match counting
- [ ] Create time-based completion
- [ ] Implement tiebreaker system

#### 3.3 Event Handling

- [ ] Add milestone events
- [ ] Create finish line events

#### 3.4 State Recovery
- [ ] Implement race state rebuilding
- [ ] Add progress recovery
- [ ] Create race resumption
- [ ] Implement validation for race recovery

### 4. Testing Infrastructure (3 days)

#### 4.1 Unit Testing
- [ ] Create test cases for all mode functions
- [ ] Implement event handling tests
- [ ] Add state management tests
- [ ] Create validation tests

#### 4.2 Integration Testing
- [ ] Implement session integration tests
- [ ] Add event persistence tests
- [ ] Create command handling tests
- [ ] Implement full game flow tests

#### 4.3 Recovery Testing
- [ ] Create recovery simulation tests
- [ ] Implement partial event stream tests
- [ ] Add corrupt event tests
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks

### 5. Documentation & Examples (1 day)

#### 5.1 Game Mode Documentation
- [ ] Create detailed API documentation
- [ ] Add state structure documentation
- [ ] Create event handling flowcharts
- [ ] Document recovery procedures

#### 5.2 Example Implementations
- [ ] Create example game flows
- [ ] Add sample command sequences
- [ ] Implement example recovery scenarios
- [ ] Create mode comparison examples

## Dependencies

- Event Store implementation
- Session Management system
- Command processing system

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks
- Mode-specific edge cases could be missed
- Recovery logic might be incomplete for complex games
- Race conditions in concurrent game actions

### Mitigation Strategies
- Create comprehensive test suite
- Implement state validation on recovery
- Add transaction support for multi-step operations
- Create thorough logging for debugging

## Testing Plan

- Unit tests for all mode functions
- Integration tests with session management
- Recovery tests with partial and full event streams
- Performance tests for state rebuilding
- Concurrency tests for parallel operations

## Success Metrics

- Complete event handling for all game modes
- Successful state recovery in all scenarios
- Test coverage > 90% for all game modes
- Documentation complete for all modes

## Timeline

- Two Player Mode Enhancement: 3 days
- Knockout Mode Enhancement: 4 days
- Race Mode Implementation: 5 days
- Testing Infrastructure: 3 days
- Documentation & Examples: 1 day

**Total Estimated Time: 16 days**
