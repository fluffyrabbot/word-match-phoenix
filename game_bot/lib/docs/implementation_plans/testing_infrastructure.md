# Testing Infrastructure Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for establishing a comprehensive testing infrastructure for the GameBot project. A robust testing framework is critical for ensuring the reliability, stability, and correctness of the system, especially given its event-sourced architecture.

## Current Status

- ✅ Basic test structure in place
- ✅ Some unit tests for commands exist
- 🔶 Partial test coverage of core components
- ❌ Missing integration tests
- ❌ Missing state recovery tests
- ❌ Missing performance and stress tests
- ❌ Missing test helpers and fixtures

## Implementation Goals

1. Establish a comprehensive unit testing framework
2. Implement integration tests for key system flows
3. Create state recovery testing
4. Add performance and load testing
5. Implement testing utilities and fixtures

## Dependencies

- Event Store implementation
- Session Management system
- Game Mode implementations
- Command processing system

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks
- Incomplete test coverage could miss critical bugs
- Performance tests might not accurately represent production load
- Recovery tests might not cover all edge cases

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement test coverage tracking and reporting
- Create production-like test environments
- Use property-based testing for edge cases
- Implement chaos testing for recovery scenarios

## Success Metrics

- Unit test coverage > 90% for core modules
- All critical paths covered by integration tests
- Recovery tested for all failure scenarios
- Performance benchmarks established and tracked
- Clear test documentation and reporting

## Timeline

- Unit Testing Framework Enhancement: 4 days
- Integration Testing Implementation: 5 days
- State Recovery Testing: 3 days
- Performance and Load Testing: 3 days
- Testing Utilities and Fixtures: 2 days

**Total Estimated Time: 17 days**
