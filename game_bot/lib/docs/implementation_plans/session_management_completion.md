# Session Management Completion Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for completing the Session Management system, which is a critical component of the GameBot architecture. The Session Management system handles game state, processes commands, and ensures reliable game play through proper state recovery and cleanup.

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ Basic `GameBot.GameSessions.Session` GenServer exists
- ‚úÖ Basic state management implemented
- ‚úÖ Session supervisor partially implemented
- ‚úÖ Basic event generation working
- üî∂ Partial game mode delegation
- ‚ùå Missing state recovery mechanism
- ‚ùå Missing cleanup process
- ‚ùå Missing monitoring and diagnostics

## Implementation Goals

1. Complete state recovery mechanism
2. Implement session lifecycle management
3. Create cleanup processes
4. Add monitoring and diagnostics

## Detailed Implementation Plan

- [ ] Create recovery validation
- [ ] Add error handling for recovery failures
- [ ] Implement partial recovery capabilities

#### 1.3 Testing & Validation
- [ ] Create test cases for recovery
- [ ] Implement recovery simulation

### 2. Session Lifecycle Management (3 days)

#### 2.1 Session Initialization Enhancement
- [ ] Improve session creation process
- [ ] Add configuration options
- [ ] Implement session metadata
- [ ] Create session registry
- [ ] Add logging for session lifecycle events

#### 2.2 Session Termination Handling
- [ ] Add graceful shutdown procedure
- [ ] Implement termination events
- [ ] Create final state persistence
- [ ] Add termination reason tracking
- [ ] Implement resource cleanup on termination

#### 2.3 Session State Transitions
- [ ] Create state transition framework
- [ ] Implement validation for transitions
- [ ] Add transition events
- [ ] Create transition error handling
- [ ] Implement state consistency checks

### 3. Cleanup Process Implementation (3 days)

#### 3.1 Completed Game Cleanup
- [ ] Create `GameBot.GameSessions.Cleanup` module
- [ ] Implement periodic cleanup job
- [ ] Add completion detection
- [ ] Create cleanup policy configuration
- [ ] Implement final state archiving

#### 3.2 Abandoned Game Handling
- [ ] Add inactivity detection
- [ ] Implement abandonment policy

- [ ] Implement scaling policies

### 4. Monitoring & Diagnostics (3 days)

#### 4.1 Session Monitoring
- [ ] Implement real-time monitoring
- [ ] Create status dashboard
- [ ] Add health checks
- [ ] Implement session metrics collection
- [ ] Create alerts for problematic sessions

#### 4.2 Performance Metrics
- [ ] Add operation timing
- [ ] Implement throughput tracking
- [ ] Create latency measurements
- [ ] Add resource usage metrics
- [ ] Implement performance trend analysis

#### 4.3 Diagnostic Tools
- [ ] Create session inspection tools
- [ ] Implement state dumping
- [ ] Add event replay for debugging
- [ ] Create log correlation
- [ ] Implement diagnostic commands

## Dependencies

- Event Store implementation
- Game Mode interfaces
- Command processing system

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks
- Recovery could be slow for long-running games
- Cleanup might terminate active games incorrectly
- Resource leaks could occur from improper termination

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement snapshot support for faster recovery
- Create robust activity detection
- Add thorough termination procedures with validation
- Implement comprehensive resource tracking

## Testing Plan

- Unit tests for all recovery components
- Integration tests for lifecycle management
- Performance tests for cleanup processes
- Chaos tests for recovery scenarios
- Load tests for concurrent sessions

## Success Metrics

- Session recovery time < 1 second for typical games
- Zero data loss on recovery
- Proper cleanup of 100% of completed/abandoned games
- Accurate monitoring with < 5% overhead

## Timeline

- State Recovery Implementation: 4 days
- Session Lifecycle Management: 3 days
- Cleanup Process Implementation: 3 days
- Monitoring & Diagnostics: 3 days

**Total Estimated Time: 13 days**
