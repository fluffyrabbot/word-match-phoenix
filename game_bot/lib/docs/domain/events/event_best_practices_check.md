# Event Architecture Best Practices Evaluation

## Overview

This document evaluates the current state of the GameBot events architecture for adherence to best practices and identifies areas for improvement. The evaluation is based on the examination of the existing codebase, particularly focusing on the event structure, implementation patterns, and adherence to the established architectural guidelines.

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Strengths

1. **Strong Foundation**
   - The architecture has a well-defined `BaseEvent` module that provides common functionality
   - Clear separation between base fields and event-specific fields
   - Consistent validation chain (base fields → required fields → metadata → custom fields)
   - Type specifications for common event structures

2. **Proper Use of Macros**
   - The `use GameBot.Domain.Events.BaseEvent` macro correctly sets up event modules
   - The `__using__` and `__before_compile__` macros provide consistent structure
   - Event type and version are properly defined as module attributes

3. **Metadata Handling**
   - Comprehensive metadata module with proper validation
   - Support for correlation and causation tracking
   - Proper handling of string/atom key normalization

4. **Validation**
   - Multi-stage validation process ensures data integrity
   - Clear separation between base validation and custom validation
   - Proper error reporting with descriptive messages

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Schema Definition Consistency

**Issue**: The `ExampleEvent` module defines its own schema with `embedded_schema` while also using `BaseEvent`.

**Recommendation**: 
- Remove direct schema definitions from event modules
- Rely exclusively on the `fields` option in `use BaseEvent`
- Ensure all events follow the same pattern for field definition

### 2. Validation Chain Integrity

**Issue**: Some validation functions in `ExampleEvent` don't call `super` in overridden methods.

**Recommendation**:
- Always call `super(changeset)` in `validate_custom_fields/1` implementations
- Maintain the proper validation order to ensure all checks are performed
- Document the validation chain clearly for developers

### 3. Field Access Patterns

**Issue**: Direct field access is used in some places instead of helper functions.

**Recommendation**:
- Use BaseEvent helper functions for field access when available
- Validate field presence before access to prevent runtime errors
- Consider adding accessor functions for common field patterns

### 4. Type Safety

**Issue**: Some type specifications are incomplete or inconsistent.

**Recommendation**:
- Use explicit types instead of generic ones (e.g., `String.t()` instead of `any()`)
- Define comprehensive `@type` specs for all events
- Document field relationships and constraints
- Use Ecto's type system consistently

### 5. Serialization Consistency

**Issue**: Custom serialization logic in event modules may diverge from the standard pattern.

**Recommendation**:
- Use the standard serialization functions provided by BaseEvent
- Avoid implementing custom serialization without clear need
- Ensure consistent handling of complex types (e.g., DateTime)

### 6. Event Creation Patterns

**Issue**: Multiple creation functions with different signatures can lead to confusion.

**Recommendation**:
- Standardize event creation functions across all event types
- Use a consistent naming pattern (e.g., `new/1`, `new/n`, `from_parent/n`)
- Document the purpose and use case for each creation function

### 7. Behaviour Implementation

**Issue**: The `@impl` annotation is used inconsistently.

**Recommendation**:
- Use `@impl true` for all behaviour implementations
- Only use `@impl` on functions that directly match the behaviour specification
- Document which functions are part of the behaviour interface

## Implementation Checklist

For each event module, ensure:

- [ ] Uses `use GameBot.Domain.Events.BaseEvent` with proper options
- [ ] Defines fields using the `fields` option, not direct schema
- [ ] Implements `required_fields/0` if custom required fields are needed
- [ ] Calls `super(changeset)` in `validate_custom_fields/1`
- [ ] Has comprehensive type specifications
- [ ] Uses `@impl true` annotations correctly
- [ ] Provides standardized creation functions
- [ ] Follows the validation chain properly
- [ ] Uses helper functions for field access when appropriate
- [ ] Avoids custom serialization without need

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Required Tests**
   - Valid event creation with all required fields
   - Validation of required fields (should fail when missing)
   - Custom validation rules specific to the event
   - Serialization and deserialization roundtrip
   - Metadata validation

2. **Test Cases**
   - Happy path with valid data
   - Missing required fields
   - Invalid field values
   - Edge cases specific to the event type

## Conclusion

The current events architecture provides a strong foundation but requires more consistent implementation across event modules. By addressing the identified areas for improvement, the codebase will become more maintainable, type-safe, and less prone to errors. The recommendations in this document should be applied to all existing and new event modules to ensure architectural integrity.

## Next Steps

1. Update the `ExampleEvent` module to follow all best practices
2. Create a template for new event modules that incorporates all recommendations
3. Review and update existing event modules for consistency
4. Enhance documentation with more examples of proper implementation
5. Add more comprehensive tests for edge cases and validation
