# Storage Efficiency Comparison for Player Information

## Overview

This document compares different approaches for storing player information in the database, focusing on storage efficiency while maintaining compatibility with Ecto.

## Approaches Compared

1. **Map Storage** - Using Ecto's `:map` type
2. **Tuple Storage** - Using Elixir tuples (not directly supported by Ecto)
3. **Custom Ecto Type** - Using a custom type that stores data as a delimited string
4. **Embedded Schema** - Using Ecto's embedded schema

## Storage Size Comparison

For storing player information with two fields: `id` and `name`

### Example Data
- Player ID: "123456789"
- Player Name: "PlayerName"

### Storage Size Estimates

| Approach | Database Storage Format | Approximate Size | Ecto Compatible |
|----------|-------------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Map | JSON: `{"id":"123456789","name":"PlayerName"}` | ~40 bytes | Yes |
| Tuple | Not directly supported | N/A | No |
| Custom Type | String: `"123456789\|PlayerName"` | ~20 bytes | Yes |
| Embedded Schema | JSON: `{"id":"123456789","name":"PlayerName"}` | ~40 bytes | Yes |

## Pros and Cons

### Map Storage
**Pros:**
- Native Ecto support
- Easy to query and update individual fields
- Flexible schema

**Cons:**
- Larger storage size due to JSON format
- Overhead of field names in storage

### Tuple Storage
**Pros:**
- Compact in-memory representation
- Efficient for passing data around in code

**Cons:**
- Not directly supported by Ecto
- Cannot be stored as a tuple in the database
- Requires conversion to/from database format

### Custom Ecto Type
**Pros:**
- Most storage-efficient option
- Full Ecto compatibility
- Maintains the convenience of structured data in code

**Cons:**
- Cannot directly query individual fields in the database
- Requires custom implementation
- Potential issues with delimiters in field values

### Embedded Schema
**Pros:**
- Full Ecto support with validation
- Clear structure definition
- Good for complex nested data

**Cons:**
- Similar storage overhead to maps
- More complex to set up

## Recommendation

For the specific case of player information (id and name pairs), the **Custom Ecto Type** approach provides the best balance of:

1. Storage efficiency (approximately 50% smaller than JSON)
2. Ecto compatibility
3. Ease of use in application code

The implementation uses a string with a delimiter to store the data, which is significantly more space-efficient than the JSON representation used by maps or embedded schemas.

## Implementation Notes

The custom type implementation:
1. Stores data as a delimited string in the database
2. Presents data as a structured map in application code
3. Supports conversion to/from tuples for backward compatibility
4. Provides proper validation

This approach allows you to maintain the storage efficiency benefits you were seeking with tuples while ensuring full compatibility with Ecto.

## Conclusion

The custom Ecto type approach provides the best of both worlds: the storage efficiency of a compact string representation with the convenience and compatibility of structured data in your application code. This approach is recommended for fields like player information where the structure is simple and storage efficiency is important.
