  - [ ] Add replay storage and retrieval
  - [ ] Create replay formatting and display

## Phase 6: Optimization and Enhancement

- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - [ ] Add caching layer for read models
  - [ ] Optimize query patterns
  - [ ] Implement pagination for large datasets

- [ ] **Web Interface (Optional)**
  - [ ] Create basic Phoenix web interface
  - [ ] Add leaderboard and statistics views
  - [ ] Implement replay browser

- [ ] **Analytics and Monitoring**
  - [ ] Add application metrics collection
  - [ ] Implement logging and error tracking
  - [ ] Create performance monitoring dashboard

## Phase 7: Testing, Documentation, and Deployment

- [ ] **Testing**
  - [ ] Write unit tests for all components
  - [ ] Implement integration tests for key flows
  - [ ] Create end-to-end game tests

- [ ] **Documentation**
  - [ ] Document API interfaces
  - [ ] Create user guides
  - [ ] Add technical documentation

- [ ] **Deployment**
  - [ ] Set up hosting environment
  - [ ] Configure database and event store
  - [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline

## Success Criteria

- Bot can run all 5 game modes with team-based play
- Events are properly stored and replays can be reconstructed
- Statistics are accurately maintained for players and teams
- System can handle multiple concurrent games across different servers
- Bot performance remains stable under load
