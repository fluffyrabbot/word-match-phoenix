  - [ ] Specify team roles and permissions

- [ ] **Replay System Specification**
  - [ ] Define replay data structures and retention policies
  - [ ] Document replay generation and access controls
  - [ ] Specify replay formatting requirements

- [ ] **User Statistics Specification**
  - [ ] Define user stat tracking requirements (wins, matches, streaks)
  - [ ] Specify rating algorithm and progression
  - [ ] Document leaderboard and ranking systems

- [ ] **Team Statistics Specification**
  - [ ] Define team stat tracking scope
  - [ ] Specify team performance metrics and calculations
  - [ ] Document team history and trend analysis requirements

## Phase 2: Core Architecture Implementation

  - [ ] Implement game aggregate
  - [ ] Develop team and user aggregates

- [ ] **Projection Framework**
  - [ ] Create projection registry
  - [ ] Implement base projection behavior
  - [ ] Set up read model update mechanisms

- [ ] **Registry and Process Management**
  - [ ] Configure game registry
  - [ ] Implement player registry
  - [ ] Create dynamic supervision system

- [x] **Word Service Implementation**
  - [x] Implement GenServer with dictionary management
  - [x] Create word matching with variations, plurals, and lemmatization 
  - [x] Add ETS-based caching for performance
  - [ ] Integrate with game modes

## Phase 3: Feature Implementation

- [ ] **Discord Integration**
  - [ ] Connect bot to Discord using Nostrum
  - [ ] Implement command parsing and routing
  - [ ] Set up direct message handling

- [ ] **Game Mode Implementation**
  - [ ] Implement base game mode behavior
  - [ ] Build two-player mode
  - [ ] Add knockout, race, golf race, and longform variants

- [ ] **Team Management System**
  - [ ] Implement team creation and membership management
  - [ ] Develop team identity functionality
  - [ ] Add team statistics tracking

- [ ] **User Management System**
  - [ ] Implement user registration and identification
  - [ ] Add user statistics tracking
  - [ ] Develop rating and ranking system

- [ ] **Replay System**
  - [ ] Implement replay generation from events
  - [ ] Add replay storage and retrieval
  - [ ] Create replay formatting and display

## Phase 4: Optimization and Enhancement

- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - [ ] Add caching layer for read models
  - [ ] Optimize query patterns
  - [ ] Implement pagination for large datasets

- [ ] **Web Interface (Optional)**
  - [ ] Create basic Phoenix web interface
  - [ ] Add leaderboard and statistics views
  - [ ] Implement replay browser

- [ ] **Analytics and Monitoring**
  - [ ] Add application metrics collection
  - [ ] Implement logging and error tracking
  - [ ] Create performance monitoring dashboard

## Phase 5: Testing, Documentation, and Deployment

- [ ] **Testing**
  - [ ] Write unit tests for all components
  - [ ] Implement integration tests for key flows
  - [ ] Create end-to-end game tests

- [ ] **Documentation**
  - [ ] Document API interfaces
  - [ ] Create user guides
  - [ ] Add technical documentation

- [ ] **Deployment**
  - [ ] Set up hosting environment
  - [ ] Configure database and event store
  - [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline

## Success Criteria

- Bot can run all 5 game modes with team-based play
- Events are properly stored and replays can be reconstructed
- Statistics are accurately maintained for players and teams
- System can handle multiple concurrent games across different servers
- Bot performance remains stable under load
