# WordService Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### Core Documentation
- [x] Defined word matching rules and constraints
- [x] Documented valid and invalid word patterns 
- [x] Specified validation rules for player submissions
- [x] Established dictionary format and requirements

### WordService Module Implementation
- [x] Created WordService GenServer with complete API
- [x] Implemented dictionary loading and management
- [x] Added word validation functionality
- [x] Implemented random word and word pair generation

### Word Matching Functionality
- [x] Implemented core matching algorithm with exact matching
- [x] Added case-insensitive matching
- [x] Created US/UK spelling variation matching (color/colour)
- [x] Implemented singular/plural form matching (cat/cats)
- [x] Added lemmatization support for word forms (run/running/runs)

### Performance Optimization
- [x] Implemented ETS-based caching for match results
- [x] Created efficient dictionary storage with MapSet
- [x] Added normalized cache keys for consistent lookups
- [x] Implemented optimized dictionary lookups

### Testing
- [x] Created comprehensive test suite for WordService
- [x] Added tests for all matching scenarios
- [x] Implemented dictionary loading tests
- [x] Added word validation and generation tests

## Remaining Tasks

### Integration
- [ ] Integrate WordService with game modes
- [ ] Create interfaces for word pair generation in games
- [ ] Add validation hooks for player submissions
- [ ] Implement match verification in game flow

### Game Mode Development
- [ ] Implement WordMatch game mode using WordService
- [ ] Create team pairing mechanics for word matching
- [ ] Add game session integration with WordService

## Next Steps

1. Implement integration between WordService and game modes
2. Create the WordMatch game mode that uses the WordService
3. Add game session management that leverages WordService functionality

## Notes

The WordService implementation explicitly excludes:
- Word statistics tracking
- Word difficulty assessment
- Word complexity measurement
- Similarity scoring (only binary success/failure matching)

This was a deliberate architectural decision to keep the service focused on its core functionality.
