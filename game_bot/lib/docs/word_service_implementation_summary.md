# WordService Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### Core Documentation
- [x] Defined word matching rules and constraints
- [x] Documented valid and invalid word patterns 
- [x] Specified validation rules for player submissions
- [x] Established dictionary format and requirements

### WordService Module Implementation
- [x] Created WordService GenServer with complete API
- [x] Implemented dictionary loading and management
- [x] Added word validation functionality
- [x] Implemented random word and word pair generation

### Word Matching Functionality
- [x] Implemented core matching algorithm with exact matching
- [x] Added case-insensitive matching
- [x] Created US/UK spelling variation matching (color/colour)
- [x] Implemented singular/plural form matching (cat/cats)
- [x] Added lemmatization support for word forms (run/running/runs)

### Performance Optimization
- [x] Implemented ETS-based caching with TTL support
- [x] Created efficient dictionary storage with MapSet
- [x] Added normalized cache keys for consistent lookups
- [x] Implemented optimized dictionary lookups
- [x] Added automatic cache cleanup process
- [x] Implemented read/write concurrency for cache tables
- [x] Added separate caches for matches, variations, and base forms
- [x] Optimized memory usage with TTL-based expiration

### Cache System Features
- [x] TTL-based expiration (24 hours)
- [x] Automatic cleanup (hourly process)
- [x] Read/write concurrency support
- [x] Memory-efficient storage
- [x] Separate caches for different operations:
  - Word matching results
  - Word variations
  - Base form calculations

### Testing
- [x] Created comprehensive test suite for WordService
- [x] Added tests for all matching scenarios
- [x] Implemented dictionary loading tests
- [x] Added word validation and generation tests
- [x] Added cache behavior tests

## Remaining Tasks

### Integration
- [ ] Integrate WordService with game modes
- [ ] Create interfaces for word pair generation in games
- [ ] Add validation hooks for player submissions
- [ ] Implement match verification in game flow

### Game Mode Development
- [ ] Implement WordMatch game mode using WordService
- [ ] Create team pairing mechanics for word matching
- [ ] Add game session integration with WordService

## Next Steps

1. Implement integration between WordService and game modes
2. Create the WordMatch game mode that uses the WordService
3. Add game session management that leverages WordService functionality

## Notes

The WordService implementation explicitly excludes:
- Word statistics tracking
- Word difficulty assessment
- Word complexity measurement
- Similarity scoring (only binary success/failure matching)

This was a deliberate architectural decision to keep the service focused on its core functionality.

## Recent Optimizations

The latest update added targeted caching optimizations:

1. **TTL-Based Caching**
   - Added expiration to prevent stale cache entries
   - Implemented automatic cleanup to manage memory usage
   - Separated caches for different operations

2. **Performance Improvements**
   - Added read/write concurrency support
   - Optimized cache key generation
   - Improved memory efficiency

3. **Cache Management**
   - Automatic hourly cleanup process
   - Efficient cache lookup with TTL validation
   - Memory-conscious storage strategy
