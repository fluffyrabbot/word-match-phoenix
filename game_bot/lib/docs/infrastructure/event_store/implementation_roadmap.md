# Event Store Implementation Roadmap

This document prioritizes improvements to our event store architecture based on technical review and current implementation status. Each item includes implementation considerations and potential pitfalls.

## Priority 1: Core Reliability Improvements

### 1.1 Enhanced Error Handling and Recovery
- [x] Basic error handling implementation
- [x] Add comprehensive error context for debugging
  - [x] Add stream ID, expected vs. actual version to concurrency errors
  - [x] Include detailed context in connection errors
  - [x] Add trace IDs for cross-component error tracking
- [x] Implement configurable retry mechanisms
  - [x] Make retry count and backoff configurable
  - [x] Add exponential backoff with jitter
  - [x] Set proper default timeouts

**Potential Pitfalls:**
- Excessive retries could mask underlying issues
- Poor backoff strategy could lead to thundering herd problems
- Missing details in error context makes production issues harder to diagnose

### 1.2 Transaction Boundary Enforcement
- [x] Basic transaction support
- [x] Add explicit transaction boundaries for multi-operation sequences
- [x] Verify rollback behavior for all error conditions
- [x] Add transaction timeout safety

**Potential Pitfalls:**
- Long-running transactions may block other operations
- Partial failures could leave data in inconsistent state
- Complex transactions spanning multiple components are harder to reason about

## Priority 2: Schema and Serialization Hardening

### 2.1 Event Schema Validation
- [x] Basic serialization implemented
- [ ] Add comprehensive validation for all event types
  - Validate event structure against schema definitions
  - Add proper error messages for validation failures
  - Include field-level validation errors
- [ ] Add event version detection and validation

**Potential Pitfalls:**
- Overly strict validation could break with minor schema changes
- Inconsistent validation between components leads to data issues
- Validation errors may be hard to interpret for users/developers

### 2.2 Future-Proof Serialization
- [x] Basic event versioning
- [ ] Implement explicit schema versioning strategy
  - Add version migration capability
  - Support deserializing older event versions
  - Add event upcasting hooks
- [ ] Add test coverage for schema evolution scenarios

**Potential Pitfalls:**
- Schema changes that break deserialization of existing events
- Performance impact from complex migration logic
- Backward compatibility issues when retrieving historical events

## Priority 3: API and Behavior Enhancement

### 3.1 Comprehensive Behaviour Specifications
- [x] Basic behavior definition
- [ ] Add detailed type specs for all callbacks
  - Add @spec annotations with success/error types
  - Document all possible error conditions
  - Specify option parameters and their effect
- [ ] Add comprehensive callback documentation
- [ ] Add sample usage examples

**Potential Pitfalls:**
- Specifications that are too rigid limit implementation flexibility
- Missing specs for edge cases leads to inconsistent implementations
- Inconsistent error handling across implementations

### 3.2 Subscription System Improvements
- [x] Basic subscription functionality
- [ ] Implement robust subscription lifecycle management
  - Add subscription cleanup on process termination
  - Handle subscription backpressure
  - Add catch-up subscription functionality
- [ ] Add filtered subscriptions

**Potential Pitfalls:**
- Memory leaks from abandoned subscriptions
- Performance issues with many active subscriptions
- Race conditions in subscription handling

## Priority 4: Operational Excellence

### 4.1 Telemetry and Monitoring
- [x] Basic telemetry integration
- [ ] Add comprehensive metrics for all operations
  - Track read/write latencies
  - Monitor subscription performance
  - Count error types and frequencies
- [ ] Add health check functions
- [ ] Implement operation tracing

**Potential Pitfalls:**
- Excessive instrumentation affects performance
- Missing critical metrics makes issues harder to detect
- Poor metric naming leads to confusion

### 4.2 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement batch operations
- [ ] Add read-side caching
- [ ] Optimize database queries and indexes
- [ ] Add connection pooling configuration

**Potential Pitfalls:**
- Premature optimization without performance testing
- Cache invalidation issues
- Increased code complexity from optimization

## Implementation Sequence

### Phase 1 (Immediate)
1. Enhanced error context and handling
2. Explicit transaction boundaries
3. Comprehensive behavior specifications

### Phase 2 (Short-term)
1. Comprehensive event validation
2. Subscription lifecycle management
3. Basic telemetry implementation

### Phase 3 (Medium-term)
1. Schema versioning and migration
2. Advanced subscription features
3. Performance optimization

## Testing Focus Areas

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Error transformation correctness
  - Validation logic
  - Retry mechanisms

- **Integration Tests:**
  - Transaction boundaries
  - Error propagation
  - Subscription behavior
  - Concurrency handling

- **Property Tests:**
  - Serialization/deserialization
  - Schema evolution
  - Error handling invariants

- **Performance Tests:**
  - Throughput under load
  - Concurrency limits
  - Recovery time after failures

## Success Criteria

- All errors include sufficient context for debugging
- Transactions properly manage multi-component operations
- Events are validated against schema definitions
- Subscriptions handle process termination gracefully
- System recovers from all error conditions
- Key metrics are available for monitoring
- Performance meets defined SLAs

## Migration Notes

1. Add enhanced error context first (lowest risk, highest value)
2. Update behavior definitions next (guides implementation)
3. Improve transaction handling (critical for reliability)
4. Add validation (prevents data corruption)
5. Enhance subscriptions (improves resilience)
6. Add performance optimizations last (measure first, then optimize)
