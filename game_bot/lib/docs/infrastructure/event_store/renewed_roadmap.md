# Event Store Implementation Renewed Roadmap

This document outlines the current status of our event store implementation and defines next priorities based on our technical review and implementation progress. This is an update to the original roadmap that reflects completed work and refined goals.

## Current Status Overview

Our event store implementation has made significant progress in core reliability and basic functionality. The PostgreSQL adapter provides foundational event streaming capabilities with error handling, transaction support, and telemetry integration. The serialization system supports JSON encoding/decoding with basic type validation.

## Completed Items

### Core Reliability
- ✅ Enhanced error handling with context-rich error types
- ✅ Configurable retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- ✅ Transaction boundaries with proper rollback behavior
- ✅ Timeouts and connection error handling
- ✅ Telemetry integration for operation tracking

### API and Serialization
- ✅ Base adapter implementation with common functionality
- ✅ Behaviour definition with clear callback specifications
- ✅ Basic event serialization with type information
- ✅ Event type registry integration
- ✅ PostgreSQL stream operations (append, read, version)
