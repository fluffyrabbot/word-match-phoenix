## Footnote: Requirements for Versioning and Migration Support

If requirements change and future updates become necessary, the following would need to be implemented:

### Schema Versioning Infrastructure
1. **Explicit version tracking:**
   - Add version field to all events
   - Create version registry to track current and historical versions
   - Implement version detection for all event types

2. **Migration framework:**
   - Develop migration functions between versions
   - Create migration registry to map version transitions
   - Implement an upcasting system for older events
   - Add downgrade paths for rollback scenarios

3. **Testing infrastructure:**
   - Create test fixtures for version migrations
   - Add property-based tests for schema evolution
   - Implement migration verification tools
   - Test serialization/deserialization across versions

4. **Documentation:**
   - Document versioning strategy and policies
   - Create migration guides for each version transition
   - Document breaking vs. non-breaking changes
   - Add schema diff tools and visualization

5. **Operational tools:**
   - Add version monitoring and alerts
   - Create schema validation tools for deployed events
   - Add migration execution and verification tools
   - Implement version conflict detection and resolution

Implementing proper versioning would add approximately 4-6 weeks to the development timeline and increase maintenance complexity significantly.
