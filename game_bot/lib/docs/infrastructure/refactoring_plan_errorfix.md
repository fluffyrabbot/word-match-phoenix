## Phase 5: Future Warning Cleanup 🔜

While the current refactoring has successfully addressed critical compiler warnings related to error handling and function signatures, there are still several categories of warnings that could be addressed in future cleanup efforts. These warnings don't impact functionality (all tests pass) but addressing them would further improve code quality.

### 5.1 Unused Variable Warnings

The codebase contains numerous unused variables that should be prefixed with underscore:

```elixir
# Before
def some_function(state, param) do
  # state is never used
end

# After
def some_function(_state, param) do
  # Clearly indicates state is intentionally unused
end
```

Priority modules to address:
- ✅ `lib/game_bot/domain/game_modes/race_mode.ex` - All unused variables now properly prefixed with underscore
- ✅ `lib/game_bot/domain/game_modes/knockout_mode.ex` - Fixed unused `team` variables in functions
- ✅ `lib/game_bot/infrastructure/error_helpers.ex` - Fixed `updated_error` variable
- `lib/game_bot/domain/events/game_events.ex` (numerous `field` variables) - Pending

### 5.2 Unused Aliases and Imports

Several modules import or alias modules that are never used:

```elixir
# Before
alias GameBot.Domain.Events.GameEvents.{
  GameStarted,  # Never used
  GuessProcessed,  # Never used
  RoundStarted
}

# After
alias GameBot.Domain.Events.GameEvents.RoundStarted
```

Priority modules to address:
- ✅ `lib/game_bot/domain/game_modes/knockout_mode.ex` - Removed unused alias `GameStarted`
- ✅ `lib/game_bot/domain/game_modes/race_mode.ex` - Removed unused aliases `GameStarted` and `GameCompleted`
- ✅ `lib/tasks/migrate.ex` - Removed unused alias `Initializer`
- ✅ `lib/game_bot/domain/game_modes/two_player_mode.ex` - Removed unused alias `GameStarted`
- Test files with unused aliases - Pending

### 5.3 Function Signature and Pattern Matching Warnings

There are several warnings about function signatures and pattern matching:

1. ✅ Incorrect arity in function calls (e.g., `GameBot.Domain.GameState.word_forbidden?/3` vs `/4`) - Fixed in race_mode.ex and two_player_mode.ex
2. Incompatible types in function arguments (Bot.Dispatcher functions) - Improved by updating Nostrum struct mocks
3. ✅ Patterns that will never match (in Listener.validate_interaction) - Fixed by adding proper pattern matching for nil types and non-interaction inputs

### 5.4 Mock Structure Type Definitions

Several warnings relate to incompatible types with the Nostrum mock structures:

```
warning: incompatible types given to GameBot.Bot.Dispatcher.handle_interaction/1:
  given types: dynamic(%Nostrum.Struct.Interaction{...})
  but expected one of: dynamic(%Nostrum.Struct.Interaction{...with additional fields...})
```

✅ Updated the mock Nostrum structures to match the fields expected in the real implementations:

```elixir
# Before
defmodule Nostrum.Struct.Interaction do
  defstruct [:id, :guild_id, :user, :data, :token, :version, :application_id]
end

# After - add missing fields to match expected structure
defmodule Nostrum.Struct.Interaction do
  defstruct [
    :id, :guild_id, :user, :data, :token, :version, :application_id,
    :channel, :channel_id, :guild_locale, :locale, :member, :message, :type
  ]
end
```

Similar updates may be needed for the Message struct mock.

### 5.5 Module Organization Warnings

Improve code organization according to best practices:

1. Group related function clauses together:
   ```elixir
   # Group these together instead of having them separated
   def handle_event(%RoundStarted{} = event) do
     # implementation
   end
   
   # ... other code ...
   
   def handle_event(%GuessProcessed{} = event) do
     # implementation
   end
   ```

2. Fix documentation redefinition issues:
   ```elixir
   # Avoid redefining @doc for functions with the same name
   # Instead, use function heads with shared documentation
   @doc """
   Documentation for both variants
   """
   def handle_game_summary(interaction, game_id)
   
   def handle_game_summary(%Message{} = message, game_id) do
     # implementation
   end
   
   def handle_game_summary(%Interaction{} = interaction, game_id) do
     # implementation
   end
   ```

### 5.6 Implementation Annotations

Properly annotate behavior implementations:

1. Add missing `@impl true` annotations to functions that implement behavior callbacks
2. Remove incorrect `@impl` annotations from functions that are not part of a behavior

### 5.7 Undefined Function Calls

Several modules call `EventStructure.validate/1` which appears to be undefined or private:

```elixir
# Before
with :ok <- EventStructure.validate(event),
     # ...

# After - use a valid alternative like:
with :ok <- EventStructure.validate_base_fields(event),
     # ...

# Or create the missing function if it was meant to exist:
```

✅ Added the missing `validate/1` function to the `EventStructure` module

There are also function call errors in the game sessions module:

```
warning: GameBot.Domain.Events.ErrorEvents.GuessError.new/5 is undefined or private
warning: GameBot.Infrastructure.Persistence.EventStore.Adapter.Base.append_to_stream/3 is undefined or private
```

These indicate incorrect function calls that should be updated to match the available API.

### Benefits of Addressing These Warnings

1. **Improved Code Readability**: Clearly indicates intent (e.g., variables intentionally not used)
2. **Reduced Code Size**: Removes unnecessary imports and aliases
3. **Better Type Safety**: Ensures function calls match expected signatures
4. **Improved Maintainability**: Makes code organization more consistent
5. **Enhanced IDE Support**: Better code navigation and error checking 

### Implementation Recommendations

While all of these issues should eventually be addressed, they can be prioritized as follows:

#### High Priority
1. ✅ Fix incorrect function calls in game sessions module that could cause runtime errors
2. ✅ Update mock structures to match expected fields to prevent type confusion
3. ✅ Fix incorrect arity function calls like `word_forbidden?/3` vs `/4`

#### Medium Priority
1. ✅ Implement missing `EventStructure.validate/1` function
2. Fix function implementations missing `@impl true` annotations
3. ✅ Address patterns that will never match

#### Lower Priority
1. ✅ Prefix unused variables with underscores
2. ✅ Clean up unused aliases and imports
3. Group related function clauses together
4. Fix documentation redefinition issues

This prioritization focuses on fixing issues that could cause runtime errors first, then addressing issues that affect code understanding and maintenance, and finally tackling purely stylistic concerns.
