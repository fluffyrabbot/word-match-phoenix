# Game Session State Recovery Implementation

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Recovery Infrastructure

#### 1.1 Base Event Handling (Completed)
- [x] Implement `GameBot.GameSessions.Recovery` module
- [x] Define core event application functions
- [x] Create state rebuilding pipeline
- [x] Add comprehensive validation
- [x] Add structured error handling
- [x] Implement performance optimizations

Core events handled:
```elixir
GameStarted      # Initializes game state
GuessProcessed   # Updates state with guess results
RoundEnded      # Handles round transitions
GameCompleted    # Finalizes game state
```

#### 1.2 Recovery Flow
```elixir
# Optimized recovery pipeline
fetch_events(game_id)
|> validate_event_stream()     # Stream-based validation for efficiency
|> build_initial_state()       # Pattern-matched state initialization
|> apply_events()             # Batch processing by event type
|> validate_recovered_state()  # Multi-stage validation
```

### Recent Improvements

1. **Enhanced Type Safety**
   - Added comprehensive error type specifications
   - Defined explicit error reasons
   - Improved function specs

2. **Optimized Event Processing**
   - Batch processing by event type
   - Stream-based event validation
   - Efficient state updates using Map.update!

3. **Improved Validation**
   - Multi-stage state validation
   - Pattern matching for GameStarted event
   - Explicit mode state validation

4. **Better Error Handling**
   - Structured error logging
   - Stacktrace inclusion
   - Detailed error context

5. **Documentation**
   - Added comprehensive function docs
   - Clarified error scenarios
   - Documented validation rules

6. **Performance**
   - Stream-based event ordering
   - Grouped event processing
   - Optimized state updates

### Phase 2: Mode-Specific Extensions

Will implement mode-specific recovery in this order:
1. [ ] Two Player Mode (simplest, base implementation)
2. [ ] Race Mode (adds time tracking)
3. [ ] Golf Race Mode (adds point system)
4. [ ] Knockout Mode (adds elimination)
5. [ ] Longform Mode (adds persistence requirements)

Each mode implementation will:
1. Define any mode-specific events
2. Add event application functions
3. Add state validation
4. Add recovery tests

### Phase 3: Supervisor Integration

- [ ] Update supervisor restart strategy
- [ ] Add crash detection
- [ ] Implement automatic recovery
- [ ] Add recovery monitoring

## Recovery Module Implementation

```elixir
defmodule GameBot.GameSessions.Recovery do
  @type error_reason :: 
    :no_events 
    | :invalid_stream_start 
    | :invalid_event_order 
    | :invalid_initial_event 
    | :event_application_failed 
    | :missing_game_id 
    | :missing_mode 
    | :missing_mode_state 
    | :missing_teams 
    | :missing_start_time 
    | :invalid_status
    | :persist_failed

  # Core recovery pipeline with optimizations
  def recover_session(game_id) do
    with {:ok, events} <- fetch_events(game_id),
         :ok <- validate_event_stream(events),
         {:ok, initial_state} <- build_initial_state(events),
         {:ok, recovered_state} <- apply_events(initial_state, events),
         :ok <- validate_recovered_state(recovered_state) do
      {:ok, recovered_state}
    end
  end

  # Optimized event application with batch processing
  def apply_events(initial_state, events) do
    events
    |> Enum.group_by(&event_type/1)
    |> Map.to_list()
    |> Enum.reduce(initial_state, fn {_type, type_events}, state ->
      Enum.reduce(type_events, state, &apply_event/2)
    end)
  end
end
```
