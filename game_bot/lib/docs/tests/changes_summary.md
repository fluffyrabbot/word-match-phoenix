# Repository Test Fixes - Implementation Summary

## Overview of Changes

The following changes have been implemented to address the test failures in the PostgreSQL adapter tests:

1. **Centralized Repository Management**: Made `test_helper.exs` the single source of truth for repository startup.
2. **Added Repository Verification**: Added robust verification that ensures repositories are fully operational.
3. **Removed Duplicate Startup Logic**: Removed repository startup logic from `EventStoreCase`.
4. **Added Test Schema Table**: Ensured the `test_schema` table exists to fix "relation does not exist" errors.
5. **Added Transaction Rollback**: Added explicit transaction rollback to prevent lingering transactions.

## Files Modified

1. **test_helper.exs**
   - Added `GameBot.Test.RepoVerification` module
   - Added repository verification after startup
   - Added test_schema table creation
   - Added explicit transaction rollback in cleanup

2. **test/support/event_store_case.ex**
   - Removed duplicate repository startup logic
   - Updated to only verify schema exists, not start repositories
   - Improved connection cleanup with explicit transaction rollback

3. **priv/repo/migrations/99999999999999_create_test_schema.exs**
   - Added migration to create test_schema table needed by tests

## How This Fixes the Issues

1. **"Could not lookup Ecto repo"** failures:
   - Fixed by ensuring repositories are started in `test_helper.exs` before any tests run
   - Added verification that repositories are actually operational
   - Added explicit error when repositories aren't properly started

2. **"Relation 'test_schema' does not exist"** failures:
   - Fixed by adding code to check for and create the test_schema table if it doesn't exist
   - Added migration file for the test_schema table

3. **Connection timeouts**:
   - Fixed by adding explicit transaction rollback before returning connections
   - Added cleanup for unexpected messages that might block connections
   - Added clear error handling for database operations

## Testing the Changes

A test script (`run_tests.sh`) has been created to test the changes in a stepwise manner:

1. First tests the adapter tests in isolation
2. Then tests the integration tests
3. Finally runs the full test suite

## Maintainability Improvements

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Repository management is now centralized in `test_helper.exs`.
2. **Clear Error Messages**: Added clear error messages when repositories fail to start.
3. **Fail Fast**: Tests will now fail immediately with clear error messages if repositories aren't ready.
4. **Robust Cleanup**: Added comprehensive cleanup to ensure resources are released properly.

## Next Steps

1. Run the tests using the provided script: `./run_tests.sh`
2. Monitor test runs for any remaining issues
3. If issues persist, review database connection settings in `config/test.exs`
