# GameBot Test Status

This document summarizes the current test failures in the GameBot project, categorized by priority and ease of fix.

## Summary

- Total tests: 551
- Failures: 142
- Excluded: 26
- Skipped: 9

## High Priority / Easy Fixes

These issues appear to be related to database configuration or initialization problems that could be fixed with relatively simple configuration changes:

1. **Ecto Repository Connection Issues** (Multiple failures)
   - Error Pattern: `could not lookup Ecto repo GameBot.Infrastructure.Persistence.Repo because it was not started or it does not exist`
   - Affected Test Files:
     - `test/game_bot/infrastructure/persistence/repo/postgres_test.exs`
     - `test/game_bot/test/database_manager_test.exs`
   - Potential Fix: Ensure test environment properly starts and configures the Ecto repository

2. **Event Store Connection Issues** (Multiple failures)  
   - Error Pattern: `Event store is not running, cannot reset`
   - Affected Areas: Multiple test files that rely on the event store
   - Potential Fix: Add proper event store initialization to test setup

3. **Serializer Validation Errors** (5 failures in `SerializerTest`)
   - Error Pattern: Serializer returning `{:error, %GameBot.Infrastructure.Persistence.Error{type: :validation...}}`
   - Affected Test File: `test/game_bot/infrastructure/persistence/event_store/serializer_test.exs`
   - Potential Fix: Update the serializer to properly handle the test event structure

## Medium Priority / Moderate Fixes

These issues appear to require more significant changes to the test setup or code:

1. **Replay Storage Issues** (9 failures)
   - Error Patterns: 
     - Key errors: `key :replay_id not found`
     - Unexpected return values from storage operations
   - Affected Test File: `test/game_bot/replay/storage_test.exs`
   - Potential Fix: Refactor the return types in storage operations to be consistent

2. **Controller Test Issues** (1 failure)
   - Error Pattern: `the table identifier does not refer to an existing ETS table`
   - Affected Test File: `test/game_bot_web/controllers/page_controller_test.exs`
   - Potential Fix: Ensure proper Phoenix endpoint initialization in test environment

3. **Transaction Test Issues** (9 failures)
   - Error Pattern: Database connection issues similar to high priority ones, but likely requiring specific transaction setup
   - Affected Test File: `test/game_bot/infrastructure/persistence/repo/transaction_test.exs`
   - Potential Fix: Implement proper transaction setup and teardown for tests

## Low Priority / Complex Fixes

These issues appear to be deeper structural problems that may require more significant refactoring:

1. **Mocking Issues** (2 failures)
   - Error Pattern: `(ErlangError) Erlang error: {:not_mocked, GameBot.Replay.EventStoreAccess}`
   - Affected Test File: `test/game_bot/replay/storage_test.exs`
   - Potential Fix: Properly set up mocks for EventStoreAccess or refactor to use test doubles

2. **Event Store Adapter Issues** (Multiple failures)
   - Error Pattern: Complex nested errors related to event store adapter functionality
   - Affected Test Files: `test/game_bot/infrastructure/persistence/event_store/adapter/base_test.exs`
   - Potential Fix: Requires deeper analysis of adapter implementation

## Root Causes Analysis

Based on the error patterns, there appear to be several underlying issues:

1. **Database Configuration**: The primary database repositories aren't being properly started or configured in the test environment.

2. **Event Store Integration**: The event store component is not properly initialized or connected in tests.

3. **Return Type Inconsistencies**: Several functions return values in formats different from what tests expect.

4. **Mock Configuration**: Some tests rely on mocks that aren't properly set up.

## Next Steps

1. Fix the database configuration in the test environment first, as this is blocking many tests.
2. Address the event store initialization issues.
3. Standardize return types in the replay storage module.
4. Fix mock setup for EventStoreAccess.
5. Address transaction-specific test issues.
