# Stats Commands

## Overview
The `StatsCommands` module handles game statistics, leaderboards, and performance metrics. All stats are server-specific and provide insights into player and team performance.

- `{:ok, discord_message}`: Formatted stats message
- `{:error, reason}`: If lookup fails

**Stats Include:**
```elixir
%{
  games_played: integer(),
  wins: integer(),
  average_score: float(),
  best_partner: String.t(),

```

### handle_leaderboard/3
Generates server leaderboard based on specified criteria.

```elixir
handle_leaderboard(%Interaction{}, type, options)
```

  ```elixir

## Display Formatting

### Player Stats Format
```

2. @player2 - 145 points

```

## Timeframe Handling

Stats can be filtered by timeframe:
- `all`: All-time stats
- `month`: Current calendar month
- `week`: Current week (Mon-Sun)
- `day`: Last 24 hours

## Error Handling

Common error cases:
```elixir
{:error, :player_not_found}    # Player hasn't played any games
{:error, :team_not_found}      # Team doesn't exist
{:error, :invalid_timeframe}   # Unknown time period
{:error, :no_data}            # No stats for period
```

## Metadata Handling

All stats queries include:
- `guild_id`: Server scope for stats
- `correlation_id`: For tracking related queries

## Performance Considerations

1. Stats are cached with 5-minute TTL
2. Leaderboards cache for 1 minute
3. Real-time stats may have slight delay
4. Long timeframes may take longer to compute
