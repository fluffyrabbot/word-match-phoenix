defmodule GameBot.Domain.GameModes.KnockoutMode do
  @moduledoc """
  Knockout Mode implementation where teams compete in rounds with eliminations.
  Teams are eliminated through various conditions until one team remains.

  ## Game Rules
  - Teams compete in rounds with a 5-minute time limit per round
  - Maximum of 12 guesses allowed per round
  - Teams are eliminated in four ways:
    1. Immediate elimination upon reaching 12 guesses without matching
    2. End of round elimination for teams that haven't matched within time limit
    3. End of round elimination for 3 teams with highest guess counts (when >8 teams)
    4. End of round elimination for 1 team with highest guess counts (when 8 or less teams)
  - Round restarts after eliminations with 5-second delay
  - Game continues until one team remains

  ## State Structure
  The mode maintains the following state:
  - Active teams and their current status
  - Round number and timing information
  - Elimination history with reasons
  - Team performance metrics

  ## Usage Example
      # Initialize mode
      {:ok, state} = KnockoutMode.init("game-123", teams, %{
        time_limit: 300,  # 5 minutes
        max_guesses: 12
      })

      # Process a guess pair
      {:ok, state, event} = KnockoutMode.process_guess_pair(state, "team1", guess_pair)

      # Check for eliminations
      {:round_end, winners} = KnockoutMode.check_round_end(state)
